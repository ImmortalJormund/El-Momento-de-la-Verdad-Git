### Focuses ###
Basque_focus:0 "Basque Focus Tree"

 
BAS_Freedom:0 "Cry of Freedom over Euskadi"
BAS_Freedom_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."
 
BAS_Utilize_Industry_in_Bilbao:0 "Utilize Industry in Bilbao"
BAS_Utilize_Industry_in_Bilbao_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."
 
BAS_Iron_Ring_of_Bilbao:0 "Iron Ring of Bilbao"
BAS_Iron_Ring_of_Bilbao_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."
 
BAS_Empty_The_Warehouses:0 "Loot Guns"
BAS_Empty_The_Warehouses_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."
 
BAS_Raise_The_Ertzana:0 "Raise the Ertzana"
BAS_Raise_The_Ertzana_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."
 
BAS_Expand_the_Iron_Ring:0 "Expand the Iron Ring"
BAS_Expand_the_Iron_Ring_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."
 
BAS_The_Great_Enemy_Falters:0 "The Great Enemy Falters!"
BAS_The_Great_Enemy_Falters_desc:0 "The Spanish, still struggling to keep their bloated carcass of former empire over the water, could have most likely squashed us in direct confrontation initially, but thanks to the emergency measures enacted by our government, we were able to produce strong enough defences to deter our former masters from attacking Euskadi."
 
BAS_Euzko_Gudariak:0 "Euzko Gudariak"
BAS_Euzko_Gudariak_desc:0 "We can no longer rely solely on the Ertzana, as modern warfare requires more than militias and police forces. The first Basque army, Euzko Gudarostea, will be formed to protect our nation from external threats, though as we are essentially building the national army from scratch, there are a lot of questions as to which famous military force to model our army on. Similarly, questions about heavy weapons, standardized equipment and transportation must be discussed, and the best strategic outlook decided upon. Still, both the men and new army leadership seem enthusiastic about the task at hand, and the generous budget given is likely to keep the spirits high."
 
BAS_Cover_the_Basics:0 "Contacts with Llama, Star and Ugartechea"
BAS_Cover_the_Basics_desc:0 "Spain was never considered the greatest manufacturer of weapons, but nonetheless the nation spawned many famous weaponsmiths and manufactories. Some of the most famous of these are now under our rule, especially the pistol crafters of Llama and Star. Star, known for the copy of the legendary Colt Model 1911, has also recently started working on a submachine gun, which we hope could prove to be a new standard weapon for Basque police forces and military personnel. However, given the needs of our fledgling military, these two companies will need to step into the production of rifles and machine guns as well, though the lucrative contract money from the government will most likely make this shift in production less of a hassle for these companies."
 
BAS_Every_Man_a_Guerilla:0 "Every Man A Gudari!"
BAS_Mobilize_BASuts_desc:0 "Gudaris, Basque militants, have arrived in droves to the recruitment offices after the independence, and this is hardly a surprise given our situation, wedged between far stronger powers. We must utilize this new patriotic fervor to provide military training to as many Basques as possible. We do not have a massive population base, which means that every man must be trained rigorously. When it comes to our Gudaris, each must be comparable to the professional armies of other armies."
 
BAS_Remembering_the_Cause:0 "Remembering the Cause"
BAS_Remembering_the_Cause_desc:0 "We must save our people, and the only way to truly do that is through steel. Weapons and machines of war must be produced, new guns and artillery created, and more soldiers trained and deployed. Only through readiness for war can we truly be saved, for war is an eternal and harsh fact of life, and the only way to truly ready ourselves is to ensure we have more guns than we know what to do with."
 
BAS_Spy_on_our_Enemies:0 "Infiltrators and Saboteurs"
BAS_Spy_on_our_Enemies_desc:0 "Warfare is, despite traditional notions to the contrary, not a glorious act performed between gentlemen. It’s a harsh, brutal and ruthless set of decisions and actions meant to maximize one force’s domination over the other. Our nation is small, its population limited and its terrain rough. We cannot rely on military prowess and bravery alone when it comes to tackling our enemies, but instead the Eusko Gudarostea must invest into more unorthodox ways of waging war. Specialists will be trained to work as spies and infiltrators. These men and women will use subterfuge and sabotage to harm our enemies, gather intelligence and corrupt their military and political institutions from the inside. While highly dangerous, this backhanded strategy is needed to give us any edge in potential wars with our neighbours."
 
BAS_Mendigoizale_Culture:0 "Militarize Mendigoizales"
BAS_Mendigoizale_Culture_desc:0 "Due to our location near the Pyrenees, Basques have developed into natural mountaineers, living alongside these vast behemoths of nature. But throughout the last decades, this mountaineering culture has evolved from a way to exercise and enjoy nature into a form of political gatherings. Mendigoizales were clubs formed by EAJ to gather Basque nationalists and hold meetings in the less inhabited areas of the Pyrenees, away from watchful Spanish authorities. This culture has meant that many of our military leaders and soldiers are masters of the mountains, something we can capitalize on by forming men with Mendigoizale experience into proper mountaineering units. They will keep our forces safe from any invasion the Spanish or French could attempt in the Pyrenean regions of our nation."
 
BAS_The_Legend_of_Basque_Sailors:0 "From Sailors to Marines"
BAS_The_Legend_of_Basque_Sailors_desc:0 "Basques are a seafaring people, our sailors have long travelled around the Atlantic and North Sea in search of whales and fish and our dockyards are some of the finest in Iberia. But while our navy takes its first few steps in the world, our military leadership has proposed that we utilize our naval traditions in the formation of a marine unit, capable of both serving as coast guards during peace time and naval military force during war time. While this unit will likely need to be small at first, our commanders hope that the experience gained from its formation will help us create similar units in the future and better theorize how they are to be used in conjunction with our navy."
 
BAS_Army_of_Fervent_Believers:0 "Spiritual Warfare"
BAS_Army_of_Fervent_Believers_desc:0 "Our men are brave and diligent in their duty, but the painful reality is that we will never match our neighbours in manpower. As such, our best hope against these overwhelming odds is to rely on the strengths and peculiarities of Basque society. If one were to spend even a single day in our cities or villages, the influence of Catholicism on our lives would become apparent in very short order. As such, our leadership feels that an introduction of special military chaplains meant to act as a morale boost to our soldiers. Just as priests are a very integral part of Basque social life, the chaplains shall be their equal on the military side. They will act as spiritual guides to our leaders and foot soldiers, help them in difficult times with the word of God and perform all rituals related to the life in the military, be they sermons or remembrance of those who have given their lives in the service.."
 
BAS_Secure_Our_Independence:0 "Defenders of Sovereignty"
BAS_Secure_Our_Independence_desc:0 "The Basque people have existed in this small space of Europe for millenia, and here we remain to this day. However, even the most fervent nationalist will concede that Basques have lived under the boots of others for centuries now, and had it not been for the hubris and errors made by our former overlords, we may well have continued to just be a province of Spain. But now that we have escaped our master’s grasp, the Basque patriotism must be stoked and maintained so if the time comes, our people will fight tooth and nail for our sovereignty."
 
BAS_First_Basque_Elections:0 "First Basque Elections"
BAS_First_Basque_Elections_desc:0 "The time has come to cast the ballots and define the ruler of our lands for the next few years. Most expect the hegemon of Basque politics, Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea to come out on top, but given the influx of Spanish people into the ranks of opposing parties and the break-up of EAJ and the Solidarists, the political scene is shaping up to be far more competitive than previously thought. While political actors like the Carlists of Navarre, the anarchists of San Sebastian and the small remnant Communist presence of Bilbao have boycotted the elections, the amount of people turning up to the elections is expected to be massive. The first trial of Basque republicanism shall begin!."
 
BAS_ELA_Victory:0 "Solidarist Victory"
BAS_ELA_Victory_desc:0 "Surprising even the union leadership themselves, Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna has managed to emerge victorious in the elections. Presenting an oddity within the Basque parties, as it is not a party at all but a worker’s union, ELA evolved into a more left-leaning actor after a large influx of socialists from the now-banned Spanish unions. This made it break with its original mother party, EAJ, but now it has triumphed over its former allies and can start work on building a Basque country for the working man. While still highly Catholic and leaning more into distributist ideas than socialist ones, the union-turned-into-party will most likely shift further leftwards and towards Christian socialism after its spectacular victory."
 
BAS_EAE_Victory:0 "Nationalist Action Victory"
BAS_EAE_Victory_desc:0 "Starting life as a small group of middle-class intellectuals separating from EAJ, there are few in Euskadi who expected this party to decisively defeat its rivals in the elections. However, as the election season closes, the party has shown itself to be the first Basque party to rise up and dislodge the Nationalist Partyfrom their lofty position as kings of the hill. The Nationalist Action must now live up to their name and put their moderate socialist and liberal nationalist programs into action, aiming to create a new Euskadi, equal, free and patriotic, unburdened by xenophobia and paternalistic attitudes."
 
BAS_EAJ_Victory:0 "Nationalist Party Victory"
BAS_EAJ_Victory_desc:0 "In an election victory that hardly anyone was surprised by, the Nationalist Party has seized the mandate to rule for a period. Consolidating decades of hard work and strong leadership into their election campaign, the party rallied the nation and showed just how dominant of a force it is in Basque society. Under the leadership of Lehendakari Jose Antonio Aguirre, the EAJ will begin transforming the republic into a Catholic, moral state with strong traditionalist values but also modern additions to represent the beautiful nation of Euskadi."
 
BAS_Aberri_Victory:0 "Aberri Victory"
BAS_Aberri_Victory_desc:0 "The entire political scene of Euskadi was throughly shaken today as Aberri, a radically traditionalist splinter group of Basque Nationalist Party, emerged as the victor of this year’s election struggle. Guided by the strong hand of Luis Arana Goiri, brother of Euskadi’s most fierce nationalist Sabino Arana, the party runs on a platform of anti-Spanish xenophobia, dogmatic Catholicism, societal conservatism and Basque ultranationalism. Taking many of its policies from Carlist intellectuals but modifying them to fit the Republican framework, the party operates in the fringe of democratic system, almost slipping to authoritarianism with many of its ideas and political positions. Though the party has stressed its continued support of democracy, many within Euskadi view it with suspicion and paranoia."
 
BAS_Rally_the_Unions:0 "Rally the Union"
BAS_Rally_the_Unions_desc:0 "If we are to reform Basque society to the new age, we must focus on our internal problems first and foremost. ELA as it stands is split almost fundamentally by the Catholic left-overs from the time we were merely an offshoot of EAJ, and the socialist newcomers from PSOE, UGT and other actors who were banned by the provisional government. We must begin a process of unifying these two sides and find a syncretic ideological basis that allows the nationalist and Catholic groups to slip into the moderate socialist parliamentarism that our new voter base demands. While this will likely be difficult to achieve and requires compromises from both sides, our leadership is optimistic that this unification will be possible."
 
BAS_Enshrine_Catholic_Socialist_Values:0 "Solidarity between Christian and Socialist"
BAS_Enshrine_Catholic_Socialist_Values_desc:0 "Ever since socialism became a popular ideology inside Catholic societies, right-wing forces have attempted to undercut its effectiveness with alternates, such as the social Catholicism peddled by parties like Aberri. ELA’s leadership has seen this rivalry to be damaging to the society, as it removes the worker’s voice and replaces it with a set of old, traditional set of hierarchical structures that must be followed. As part of the transformation from a polarized union into a unified party, ELA must incorporate Christian values and ethics but combine them with the socialist agenda of empowering the worker. After all, Jesus was a carpenter, and thus as we follow his religious message, we can also help those of his class in our time."
 
BAS_Taxation_for_the_Common_Man:0 "Taxation For the Common Man"
BAS_Taxation_for_the_Common_Man_desc:0 "One of the political changes that all Basques agree on is taxation. Relying on the Spanish taxation system, especially given its archaic nature and regionally incompatible peculiarities, is simply unacceptable. We must reform the entire economic system to finally provide a monetary policy that puts the common man, the noble toiler that makes up the majority of our people, into the forefront."
 
BAS_Democratize_Unionism:0 "From Union to a Proper Party"
BAS_Democratize_Unionism_desc:0 "So much work, inter-party politics, backroom deals and so, so many compromises, and finally, the Solidarists have rallied under the new party. No longer are we an union, but an actual party. The stranglehold of Nationalist Party on us, and even on all of Euskadi, is finally over. But this new unity has raised other questions. Where do we go from here? Who do we align with ideologically? If we are to continue onwards, these questions must be addressed."
 
BAS_Devotion_of_the_Basque_Worker:0 "Nationalism, Faith and Socialism as Our New Creed"
BAS_Devotion_of_the_Basque_Worker_desc:0 "The Nationalist Party is well-known for their slogan, God and Old Laws. While we have embraced modernity alongside the old laws, it is clear that we need similar core values to build the new Christian socialist movement around. Given our independence was a recent event, we can harness Basque nationalism to become a cornerstone of the new party, combined with the word of God and the ideological basins of Christian socialism, taking notes from the Italian and French movements that have theorized this style of united faith and ideology. We will offer an alternative to the social Catholicism of Carlists and Aberri, and the revolutionary currents of CNT-FAI and PKE."
 
BAS_Build_Bridges_Over_the_Pyrenees:0 "Bridges Over the Pyrenees"
BAS_Build_Bridges_Over_the_Pyrenees_desc:0 "Over our borders to the East, our fellow blood brothers continue to suffer under the French Communards, like they have been for centuries through oppression under the perfidious Franks, with their identity eroded, their status disrespected, while their oppressors want nothing more but to “assimilate”, that is, to eradicate our people’s proud identity and make our people being treated like second class Frenchmen. Now that we have built a state for the Basque people to call their own, it is time for us to build connections with our fellows across the Pyrenees, and prepare for their inevitable liberation from their centuries-long oppression, and the unification of all the proud peoples of Euzkadi."

BAS_Attract_Foreign_Capital:0 "Invest in Euskadi!"
BAS_Attract_Foreign_Capital_desc:0 "Our position both internally and on the world stage is a precarious one. To the South, despite our hard-earned independence, Spanish dogs are still licking their wounds, ready to strike back at any moment of weakness. To our distant East, the Syndicalist devils of France are still preparing for a war against the moral peoples of the world, and it is likely that we won’t be able to escape the fires of war soon. All of this, while our state remained underdeveloped; as while our people are hardy and pious, our economy remained stagnant and agrarian, and our industrial capacity remained limited, with even our main industrial hub of our new nation, Bilbao, which was built under the Spanish and is still found lacking compared to our industrial centers of Europe. However, our precarious political position also provides an opportunity: With our strategic position in the Atlantic and capable of striking at the rear of the Syndicalists through the sea, we can leverage this to our advantage in negotiating with foreign powers in Canada, Berlin and more to invest in our nation, so as to give the Basque nation the tools it needs to industrialize and to truly leap into modernity."

BAS_Strengthen_Republicanism:0 "God, Fueros and Republic"
BAS_Strengthen_Republicanism_desc:0 "Our Euskadi is home to some of the most resilient sons of Europe, and of the Faith in the Lord. Through the old fueros, we have retained our proud culture and traditions through the centuries even with the encroachment and centralization from the Spaniards, while Catholicism has been a pillar of our people’s culture, especially with the emergence of Basque nationalist awakening through Catholic education. With the establishment of our new Republic, the new core tenets of Basque society shall be solidified with Republicanism, Catholicism and the Old Laws of the Fueros, as only a Republic, and not some old kings, can defend our people, while only through the reinstatements and perhaps modernization of Fueros, along with reaffirming the faith in the Lord can our country be a pious and stable country."

 
BAS_Form_the_Popular_Front:0 "Lead the Popular Front"
BAS_Form_the_Popular_Front_desc:0 "Despite our victory in the first elections, we do not have the support to pass our policies easily without compromising with the right or the left. While we share certain ideas of governance and policies with EAJ, we did not split from their party just to go back and beg for support, so the option of compromising with them is out of question. However, we can search for support from those parties that did not participate in the elections but could be interested in collaborating with our government. We must send envoys and negotiators to a group that left our party, the EAE Autonomists, as well as the local branch of CNT-FAI and the remnant party of EPK. We could also include our rivals in the Solidarists, who we defeated in the elections but do share a lot of values and ideals with. We could follow the Spanish strategy from the times of the republic and form a Popular Front government with these parties, combating the immense strength of the right. This will make it so that we must keep making compromises with the leftist parties, but it will make our position stronger in the parliament."

BAS_Propel_Euskadi_Into_Modernity:0 "Euskadi Rises to Modernity"
BAS_Propel_Euskadi_Into_Modernity_desc:0 "Basque culture and society revolves so heavily around tradition and generational continuity that it is a miracle we have progressed at all from the Middle Ages. But despite the fact that new modes of governance, technology and societal models have been, and are constantly being, adopted by the Basque people, there is still mountains of work to be done for our new republic to truly be a beacon of modernity. However, EAE leadership has never given up a challenge, and now men like Anakleto Ortueta and Luis Urrengones, long time patriots and progressives, will finally help Euskadi turn a new leaf to modernity. Euskadi, built upon republican values of solidarity, unity beyond the confines of race and financial equality, will show the people of this great nation that there are alternatives to the fervent Catholic fundamentalism."
 
BAS_Preserve_Basque_Culture:0 "Celebrate Basque Culture"
BAS_Preserve_Basque_Culture_desc:0 "Ever since first concepts of Basque independence were theorized by the likes of Arana brothers, Basque culture has been nurtured and protected by nationalist figures, sheltered from the centralist influences of Castile by these brave patriots. With our independence secured, we must divert funding into various institutes researching the Basque language in the hopes of finally standardizing it, and some spending is allocated to various festivals of the Basque country, especially Aberri Eguna, to make sure that every Basque will realize just how unique and special our ways are."
 
BAS_The_Founders_Vision:0 "The Founder's Vision"
BAS_The_Founders_Vision_desc:0 "It is no secret that Sabino Arana is a national hero for all Basques. Statues of Arana are being raised after the independence, the traditional Ikurriña flag made by him and his brother, our leader, flies over many Basque households, and his influence is deeply evident in Basque vocabulary, party politics, cultural works and even names used by people. As we, Arana’s most devoted followers, now joined his brother Luis in our great victory, and to celebrate this victory without celebrating our glorious founder and the most exemplary Basque man would be a sin. Let us follow his true vision to the letter, and create Euskadi, his life’s project, just like it was always meant to be!"
 
BAS_Curtail_Harmful_Vices:0 "A New Age of Morality"
BAS_Curtail_Harmful_Vices_desc:0 "We may be fierce defenders of Basque nationhood and sovereignty, but we are also devout sons of Christ, and it is our duty to embed the virtues of the Lord’s faith to our peoples. Harmful vices of prostitution, smoking and more shall be removed from our new society, and in their place, faith in the Lord and the virtues he preaches shall be taught to our people, and piety will spread to all within this proud country of Euskadi."

BAS_Expel_the_Outsiders:0 "Purify Euskadi from Maketos"
BAS_Expel_the_Outsiders_desc:0 "Maketo is a term used by Sabino Arana to refer to the Spanish, and it is quickly developing into somewhat of a slur in the circles of the Aberrianos when referring to our imperialist oppressors. Now that Spanish influence on us is finally pushed away, the time has come to expel those maketos that still infect our lands with their corruption. While there are many Spaniards who have integrated their lives here and are acceptable members of the society, the amount of maketo immigrants, Spanish administrators and other agents of the Alfonsist regime is unbearable. While it will be a controversial solution both domestically and internationally, we must expel these interlopers once and for all to save Basque society from being overwhelmed by outside forces."
 
BAS_Mobilize_the_Masses:0 "Expand the Aberriano Organization"
BAS_Mobilize_the_Masses_desc:0 "It is becoming painfully difficult to maintain our grip on power as the strong jeltzales of EAJ try to wrestle against our parliamentary majority at every turn, constantly undermining the authority of lehendakari Arana and his ministers. This cannot continue, and thus we must expand our recruitment into as many loyal Basque patriots as possible. While the EAJ and EAE recruit among the maketos, we can never do such heresy. Spaniards can never be true Basques, and thus they have no place in our organization. The party will spread more of its propaganda among the Mendigontzales, making sure to slowly reel in the mountaineering organization as part of the Aberrianos. The party newspaper, Jagi-Jagi, will be further funded and its reach spread out all throughout Basque country, hopefully even reaching over the mountains into French Basque country. We must become more than just a splinter of EAJ if we wish to survive parliamentary politicking."
 
BAS_Contact_Our_Irish_Comrades:0 "The Irish Connection"
BAS_Contact_Our_Irish_Comrades_desc:0 "Ireland’s struggle for independence has been a great source of inspiration and motivation to our Basque patriots, and when the Irish managed to wrest away from the control of the British imperialists, many Basques rejoiced alongside them. With our new republic heavily modeled after the Irish state, we should reach out to our Irish friends and open a pact of friendship to further the bond between our two anti-imperialist nations."
 
BAS_Align_with_the_Hegemon:0 "Align with the Global Hegemon?"
BAS_Align_with_the_Hegemon_desc:0 "While Germany and Spain were often quite close during the Primo de Rivera era, they have since drifted further apart due to various circumstances. Spain’s failure to keep its country apart is probably not a great look on them on the global stage. We could offer to join Reichspakt in their stead, given our strategic location right next to the French syndicalist backdoor."
 
BAS_Join_The_Double_Eagle:0 "Ally the Defenders of Catholic Order"
BAS_Join_The_Double_Eagle_desc:0 "Few things define Basque society as much as the Catholic faith. And few nations in Europe are as fierce defenders of that most glorious religion than the Austrians, resisting reformation, atheism and Muslim encroachment on Europe for centuries, their empire controlling the very heartlands of our faith. We must join them in this good fight, for the preservation of true Catholic values."
 
BAS_Armed_Neutrality:0 "Basques, Alone!"
BAS_Armed_Neutrality_desc:0 "We cannot trust a single soul outside our own borders, for all foreign powers circle our infantile state like wolves on the hunt. We must stand resolute and strong, protecting our independence and our neutrality with military might. BASutia shall not become a slave to foreign entanglements and whims so soon after freeing ourselves from such nightmares."
 
BAS_Compromise_with_Internationale:0 "Compromise with the Internationale"
BAS_Compromise_with_Internationale_desc:0 "Right next to us over the border lies the main player of the Third Internationale, the Commune of France. While we still have unresolved border disputes due to the presence of large Basque minority in French Basque country, we must put these irredentist ideals aside to achieve a compromise with the Internationale and find allies who would protect us from the Spanish menace."
 
BAS_The_Wild_Card:0 "The Wild Card"
BAS_The_Wild_Card_desc:0 "The Basques, having suffered so long under the Spanish crown, are understandably not that interested in allying other European powers who would only seek to dominate us in Castile’s stead. We must turn our eyes eastwards, towards the rising power of Japan, which is rapidly positioning itself as a primary anti-colonial actor in the world. That is a fight we can easily get behind, and our naval tradition mirrors that of Japan’s so making connections overseas should not be particularly difficult."

BAS_Euskadi_Economy_Springs_Up_desc:0 "With our independence secured, we must work towards creating a truly prosperous, modern economy free from the entrapments of our imperialist past. Without a bustling economy, our new state shall wither and die before it can even draw first breath, and so the creation of a new financial system to support our infantile nation is a top priority."

BAS_The_Riches_of_Our_Lands_desc:0 "The Pyrenean mountains hold many treasures to be excavated and put to use to enrich our lands and our people. Utilizing companies and tools left behind by the Spanish, we can get to work on making our nation one of the primary suppliers of rare and common minerals in Europe, both to boost domestic industry and to be sold to foreign markets."
 
BAS_Kickstart_Basque_Industrial_Revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution Lands to Euskadi"
BAS_Kickstart_Basque_Industrial_Revolution_desc:0 "The city of Bilbao was always one of the few places in Spain, alongside Barcelona, where the Spanish managed to get industrial development underway. This was partially because of the city’s central location and large harbour and partially because of the entrepreneurial spirit of the Basque people. Now, we can finally kickstart the Iberian industrial revolution when wider problems of the Spanish state no longer hamper our foundries and factories."
 
BAS_Agriculture_as_Our_Backbone:0 "Agricultural Machine to Feed Our People"
BAS_Agriculture_as_Our_Backbone_desc:0 "The Basque society has traditionally been divided into two rough classes, fishermen and farmers. While things are no longer quite as simple as back in the good old days of rural labour, with the urban workers creating a whole new subset of people in Basque country, these two Basque groups still provide most of our sustenance to this day. Fishing remains as important as ever, but it has remained largely the same for centuries, while in the agricultural field, new machines like tractors and trucks could help us greatly in achieving the output our nation needs to feeds itself."

BAS_Minas_de_Rodalquilar_desc:0 "Minas de Rodalquilar are a large set of mines, nestled near the Pyrenean mountains, originally opened by Spanish explorers and prospectors. These mines have, in the past, provided enough hints of a proper goldmine that exploring the matter further could be highly beneficial for our nation. We must nationalize these mines and fund them properly, as the possibility of a Basque Klondike is too great of an opportunity to pass by."
 
BAS_Develop_Machinery:0 "Mechanize Every Aspect of Basque Life"
BAS_Develop_Machinery_desc:0 "Spain at large was severely lacking behind in introducing machinery to its society, be it farming equipment, different production machines or just public transportation. We must learn from this mistake and bring about a complete mechanization of Basque life, making trains, trams, trucks and buses a common sight on Basque streets and tractors a way of life similar to horses in the rural countryside. Through the power of the machine shall we tame these wild lands in a way the maketos never could."

BAS_Bring_Deustuko_Unibertsitatea_Into_Public_Ownership_desc:0 "Deustuko Unibertsitatea, or the University of Deusto, is the main centre for higher studies in Basque country. Originally founded by the Jesuits, the republican era reforms weakened the influence of religion in its teaching, and to some degree, left it somewhat stranded as far as funding and personnel was concerned. We have the golden opportunity to nationalize it and invest into it for Basque country to have a proper home for its blooming academia."

BAS_Llama_and_Star_desc:0 "Euskadi has a long history with gunsmithing, and the best-known firearms manufacturers in Iberia come from this region, especially the excellent craftsmen of pistols  Llama and Star. Llama is known for their famous copy of Colt pistols in local 9 millimetre Largo calibre, while Star has recently developed one of Iberia’s first domestic submachine guns, the Star Si-35. With these two arms manufacturers now supported by the Basque state, they can expand their technological department and create guns for both our own military and for sales abroad in the new, tumultuous global situation !"

BAS_Fund_Ferrocarriles_Vascongados_desc:0 "Ferrocarriles Vascongados is a local railway company that at the start of the century merged from three different companies to create the first Basque rail network. While Basque railways are still in their infancy and much work is needed for the nation to have a proper national railway line, we believe that with correct funding the FV company can get our nation right on track towards a proper rail network connecting our cities and towns with fast and efficient train lines."

BAS_Industry_to_Rival_Spain_desc:0 "With all the industrial developments behind us, Euskadi has utilized its base industrial progress to truly become the factory of Iberia, producing goods for civilians and militaries alike.

BAS_Syndicalist_Revolution:0 "Syndicalist Revolution"
BAS_Syndicalist_Revolution_desc:0 "The unlikely revolution of Basque coastal fishermen and dockworkers has occurred, leading to the destruction of the bourgeois republic and its replacement with the anarchist order.

BAS_Destroy_Nationalist_Influence:0 "Eradicate Aberri Ultranationalists"
BAS_Destroy_Nationalist_Influence_desc:0 "The Aberri traditionalists have an almost religious cult towards the Basque nationalist Sabino Arana, and while our anarchists do view that man in quite high regard, the traditionalist and authoritarian nature of Aberri is simply incompatible with our new ideological basis. As such, we must push the reactionaries away from our lands, by force if need be, lest they sabotage our revolution."

BAS_Memory_of_Los_Justicieros_desc:0 "The Los Justicieros group of Buanaventura Durruti was one of the first appearances of anarcho-syndicalism in Basque Country, and the example of brave anti-statist resistance of those ideological comrades still guides us to this day.

BAS_Refurbish_San_Sebastian_desc:0 "While Bilbao is the industrial heartland of Basque country, San Sebastian is its red heart. Los Justicieros plotted to assassinate king Alfonso XIII here, and for Basque culture, the city is immensely important. We must refurbish the city to fully fit our new order, to show to the Basque people that the labours of the anarchists are here to benefit everyone, and that while the state of Basque country may be overthrown, the Basque culture shall thrive under our rule."
 
BAS_Concessions_to_Tradition:0 "Concessions to the Church"
BAS_Concessions_to_Tradition_desc:0 "While CNT-FAI in wider Iberia is known for their violent and brutal anti-clericalism, it’s clear that religion is immensely important to the Basque people. Thus, it would be foolish and dangerous to our movement to go after the church so soon after the transition period, and thus we must give some concessions to the Catholic clergy in order to win the hearts and minds of the Basque people."
 
BAS_The_Course_of_Our_Movement:0 "The Course of Our Movement?"
BAS_The_Course_of_Our_Movement_desc:0 "It is clear that the anarchists of San Sebastian are mainly concerned with worker rights and union activism before any real ideological leanings.

BAS_Create_Syndicalist_Unions:0 "Alliance with the Solidarists"
BAS_Create_Syndicalist_Unions_desc:0 "While the Solidarists of ELA are noted for being an union very tightly aligned with the Basque Nationalist party, their recent influx with socialists did transform the movement into a more socialist direction. While still mainly an unit of Christian socialism even at its most radical, we could find an ally in them over similar shared convictions of worker’s rights and people’s welfare. Besides, our French allies over the border also tolerate Christian unions, so we should not be ruthless in our actions either."
 
BAS_Nationalize_Euskalduna:0 "Euskalduna Painted Crimson and Black"
BAS_Nationalize_Euskalduna_desc:0 "Euskalduna is the largest shipyard and harbour complex in Bilbao, and even by European standards it stands as a massive complex.

BAS_Crimson_Coast:0 "The Crimson Coast"
BAS_Crimson_Coast_desc:0 "Many expected our chaotic movement to simply collapse upon itself, but we have triumphed in our actions and driven back the reactionaries that would seek to see our movement squashed.

BAS_Jacobins_Seize_the_Day_desc:0 "With the threads of history in their favour, the Syndicalist devils of the CNT-FAI, Catholic reactionaries and bourgeois-republican idealists has been swept aside, as a new revolutionary wave engulfs Euskadi, brought by the tireless efforts of the Red Jacobins of Basque Country, ending their bitter exile and bringing the revolution to its triumphant conclusion."

BAS_Centralization_Through_Any_Means_desc:0 "While we have secured nominal leadership over the Basque country, these lands are rife with subversion, as remnant reactionaries, syndicalist traitors and other assorted dissidents still roam the countryside, trying to overturn the revolution, the Spanish across the border are attempting to incite divides between the Basque and Spanish. Even worse, our nation’s economy has been severely disrupted due to the recent war and political turmoil. We must make haste to centralize our nation under one leadership, while resuming economic control over the nation and setting the foundations for a socialist economy. Through centralizing all economic activities under the State and by extension, the Party, we can prevent reactionary subversion from infiltrating further and disrupting the construction of socialism here."

BAS_Revive_the_Spectre_of_Communism_desc:0 "The reactionaries, from the royalist failsons and the bourgeois nationalists, and even the syndicalist opportunists may claim that Communism is a farce, and Marxism a failure, solely because of comrade Lenin’s failure in Russia. However, we have successfully brought the revolution to our own corner of Iberia, returning Communism to its place in the world stage, and we shall make the world see that the Spectre of Communism and its crimson banner has awoken from its hibernation, and it shall bring forth a better world without chains, not the Syndicalist rabble who would rather cooperate with reactionary classes and roll back everything the revolution has achieved."
 
BAS_Bend_the_Unions_to_Our_Will:0 "Remove Christ From the Unions"
BAS_Bend_the_Unions_to_Our_Will_desc:0 "The largest unions in our nation, to our dismay, are almost filled with reactionaries, either from the rabble rousers of the CNT-FAI, and the unions that are not affiliated with the anarchists, such as the Basque’s Workers Solidarity, unfortunately are also a stronghold of the EAJ and their bourgeois conservative, pro Catholic rhetoric. It is time to change this unfortunate reality, as  all unions will be put under a Central Union under the Party’s control, and force their membership to be vetted and educated to prevent further subversion, and to create a new proletarian generation loyal to the Party and to Socialism."

BAS_Bring_in_French_Theorists_desc:0 "While the revolution has been gradually stabilized under our careful watch, our fledgling nation is still lacking in even the most basic requirements of a nation-state, in education, infrastructures and modern technologies, a consequence of Spanish neglect, devastation and chaos following our recent secession from Spain. By bringing in French theorists and military men to train our administrators and soldiers, the bountiful benefits of socialism shall be opened to all Basque peoples, while retaining our solidarity with our fellow socialist brethren."

BAS_Introduce_Cult_of_Reason_to_Iberia_desc:0 "Iberia, and these lands that we call our homeland in particular, have been shackled for centuries by the Catholic Church and their oppressive faith, stunting the Basque people from embracing the Enlightenment that has swept through the world. As heirs of the French and Russian Revolutions, we shall bring this unacceptable situation to an end. The clergy’s regressive stranglehold will be destroyed. and in its place, with tireless efforts from our loyal cadres and sans-culottes to educate and guide the people, a new Iberian Cult of Reason shall be established, as our own provocation to the people to free themselves from their own barriers of reactionarism in all its forms, and to venerate the sacred virtues of Liberty, Freedom and Socialism, in our ceaseless march towards the Communist ideal."

BAS_Rekindle_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As we pride ourselves as the proud heirs of Bolshevism and Jacobinism alike here in the troubled lands of the Basque nation, it is only natural that class struggle shall be our order of the day in the path towards Communism. However, there remained many, such as the Abertzales, or ‘patriotic left’ of the EAE and Solidarists of the ELA who still seek to oppose us, defending, sheltering the bourgeoisie and openly opposing the new Socialist Republic. These ‘socialists’ claimed to stand with the toilers, but in practice, they are merely Social-Reactionaries, capitulating to petty nationalist bourgeoisie, placating them in exchange for mere breadcrumbs. We shall mobilize our proletarians, and they will know their task in subjugating whoever seeks to destroy the new revolutionary order, whether it’s the former oppressors, or the traitors in red clothing alike."
 
BAS_Fortitude_of_the_Party_Line:0 "Fortitude of the Party Line"
BAS_Fortitude_of_the_Party_Line_desc:0 "While the party remained nominally united, there has been much dissension within our ranks since our rise to power. Because of our position as the main communist force in Iberia, and we have taken in many exiled communists ever since the Kingdom of Spain’s folly in foolishly angering the peoples of Spain in doubling down on the caciquismo. As a consequence of this, our party’s ideological foundations are diverse, united around our admiration of the French Communists, and our own dream of bringing communism to our homeland and to all of Iberia. While a diversity in thought is good for maintaining constructive criticism in democratic centralism, we must deter any attempt at factionalism and maintain our party’s focus on bringing a Red Jacobin revolution to Iberia."

BAS_First_Jacobins_of_Iberia_desc:0 "While a socialist spring blooms over these rugged lands, our brothers across all corners of Iberia remain in chains under despotic bourgeois rule. And thus, our path is clear: From Euskadi, we shall pour forth and be the vanguard troops of a new Iberian Revolution, and the light of the Red Jacobin ideal shall shine forth against the reactionaries of yore, and neither the fat clergy, the greedy capitalists and whoever else that seeks to stem the revolutionary tide shall stand in our way."

BAS_Return_to_Tradition:0 "Return to Tradition"
BAS_Return_to_Tradition_desc:0 "The foolish socialists and republicans thought they could destroy one of the longest standing resistance movements in Iberia, and for that, they have paid the price.

BAS_Contact_Claimants_desc:0 "We must immediately contact the claimants to the Carlist throne, Javier of Bourbon-Parma and Carlos Pius Habsburg-Lorena y de Borbón. However, given that we have restored the Kingdom of Navarre, the succession laws may not be quite as simple to follow, and our Basque rival Carlists, ever vigilant for Spanish encroachment on their lives, have found certain peculiarities in the succession laws so that they might try something in the ceremony aimed at selecting the king."
 
BAS_Invite_Spanish_Carlists:0 "Our Spanish Comrades"
BAS_Invite_Spanish_Carlists_desc:0 "While the Alfonsists won the elections and sent the Carlist movement into a spiraling collapse, many Spaniards still remain loyal to the true cause of Carlism.

BAS_Reinvigorate_Carlist_Unionism_desc:0 "Sindicatos Libres was a worker’s union present in Spain throughout the late 1910s and 1920s, fighting anarchist strikers when their demands grew too revolutionary and anti-clerical. While not particularly strongly Carlist in ideology, the union’s leadership had a majority of Carlists in it, and thus we could form our own Sindicatos Libres department here, to drive the Carlist worker’s cause and to help us curtail socialist and syndicalist infiltration in our societies."

BAS_Ally_the_Moderates_desc:0 "The liberals of the republic sought to destroy traditional values of the Basque country and replace it with an Europeanized, sterile and secular order that would wipe out all of our culture and most valued specialities away to create a formless, tasteless society of individuals.

BAS_Eradicate_Socialist_Vermin_desc:0 "The anarchists of Biscayan coast are thankfully only a minority, but nevertheless, our close proximity to the French border could incite lost souls to rebellion and sabotage.

BAS_Basque_Tint_to_Our_Movement_desc:0 "Basque country and Navarre have always been the two regions most active at creating new fighters for the Carlist cause, and this is not surprising given that out of all the provinces of Spain, these two are the most pious and live life according to the values of God, king and fueros, the three cornerstones of Carlism. Even under the republic, the Basques retained their Catholic values, and now that the godless regime of liberals has been overthrown, true traditionalism may bloom over the Pyrenees once more."

BAS_Show_of_Goodwill_desc:0 "The ikastolak, a system of Basque schooling, were originally sprung up as a protest to the secularization of Spanish schools, and to also teach Basque children and youth in their native language.

Under the tree of Gernika, our new king shall swear his oath to uphold the values of the fueros, ancient laws meant to uphold autonomy of the Spain’s minorities, something the Alfonsist pretenders simply stomped on repeatedly during their morally corrupt reign.

While many of them are too old to be utilized in naval combat, they can still be used for gunnery training, disciplinary exercises and to teach our men on how to maintain their vessels, equipment and weaponry.

BAS.1.t:0 "Spanish No More!"
BAS.1.d:0 "For so long, Euskadi has been nothing but a province of Spain. They have tried to erase our identity, our language, our customs and our culture. But no more will we listen to the commands of Madrid, no more will they dictate how the rich lands of Euskadi are governed. From Bilbao to the Pyrenees, Euskadi is free, and our people are ready to fight and die to retain that freedom, no matter the odds!"
BAS.1.a:0 "Independence!"

BAS.2.t:0 "Eusko Gudarostea"
BAS.2.d:0 "The Eusko Gudarostea, our national army, has been mobilized for the first time. Initially merely a militia force, our commander in chief, Alberto de Montaud Noguerol, has reformed this fledgling force into a proper military. Supplied with guns smuggled in from both Commune of France and Ireland, this hodgepodge arsenal shall serve as deterrent against the blasted Spaniards until we create a more standardized system. For now, the dusty Lebels and Lee-Enfields will be our sword and our faith in the Lord our shield, and with them we shall strike down the Spanish invader should they dare to enter our rightful land. However, we must not remain idle, much work is to be done for our military to be truly modern and on par with that of Spain and our other neighbours."
BAS.2.a:0 "Eusko Gudariak gora!"

BAS.3.t:0 "Defector Caught!"
BAS.3.d:0 "As the Iron Ring of Bilbao was being reinforced, Ertzana motorized police forces have detained the man responsible for much of the designs of the fortifications, Alejandro Goicoechea. He was caught while attempting to escape to the Spanish side of the border, the entire plans of the Iron Ring of Bilbao on the passenger seat beside him. After interrogation, the man broke and revealed that he was a member of the Liga de Acción Monárquica, a Spanish Alfonsist party thought to have been dissolved with the proclamation of the republic. The party was originally founded to help contain Basque nationalism and seek to eradicate it, as the insidious Spaniards have always attempted to, but it seems that the monarchists have now turned to blatant sabotage to drive their arms further. \n\nMany nationalists demand that Goicoechea is executed for treason, and the assets of the monarchists are to be seized, with the supporters of Alfonso XIII detained at least until the end of the war, until a proper trial is held. The socialists, now part of ELA, have demanded that their property is nationalized altogether, to help us fight the foe these monarchists were so eager to support. However, more moderate members of EAE and EAJ have instead argued that we should just seize the assets temporarily and imprison Goicoechea until the war is over and a fair trial can be held."
BAS.3.a:0 "Execute Goicoechea and nationalize the properties, no mercy for the traitor!"
BAS.3.b:0 "Imprison Goicoechea and temporarily seize the properties, they will face justice after the war!"

BAS.4.t:0 "Banning of Spanish Parties"
BAS.4.d:0 "With the war looming just over the horizon, the provisional government has issued a slew of emergency legislation, among them a controversial bill banning all inherently Spanish parties from operating in Basque territory. This has spared some Basque dominated parties, such as Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Unión Navarra from facing the ban, but powerful parties such as the socialist party PSOE, Izquierda Republicana and Accion Popular have been completely removed from the parliamentary politics. The ban has also struck Spanish unions, such as UGT, whose members have flocked to the traditionally Catholic trade union Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna. The Solidarists, as they are often called, have been completely overwhelmed by this new flood of members, and it has severely tipped the union towards socialist politics, although still heavily dominated by Christian values as well. The provisional wartime government has argued that this ban would make it far harder for Spanish imperialists to organize inside Euskadi, but many journalists and opposition politicians have also claimed that this is simply a blatant ultranationalist concession to the Aberri wing of the EAJ, which has recently separated to form their own party."
BAS.4.a:0 "Concession or not, the ban stays. We are Basques now, not Spanish!"

BAS.5.t:0 "Guardia Civil Surrenders!"
BAS.5.d:0 "As the Basque rebellion was proclaimed, Basque nationalists and Carlist militants quickly encircled local Guardia Civil garrisons, and in most of them, forced the local guards to lay down their arms. However, given that the territory was basically the buffer zone between Commune of France and Spanish heartlands, there were more than enough Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops in the area to overpower the Basque militias before they had time to mobilize and arm themselves. Yet when the rebellion came, no concentrated Spanish military effort was taken to decimate it, but instead the central command of the local Guardia Civil, the commanders office in Pamplona, ordered the local forces to stand down. \n\nFew Basques had expected it, but the leader of the Pamplona Guardia Civil, José Rodríguez-Medel, had decided not to support the Madrid regime. When Basque militants came to arrest him, the commander explained that in 1932, when the republic was destroyed, he had been powerless to stop the development. However, now, with Madrid falling to an autocratic and corrupt regime, he could fight back against bastards like Sarjurjo, whose rule he considered illegitimate. As such, he ordered his men to surrender and the armouries of Guardia Civil fell to the hands of the Basque militias, who quickly seized hundreds of rifles, El Tigre and Destroyer carbines and thousands of handguns. Rodríguez-Medel was removed from military command, but he was given a civilian role in the new Basque administration due to his engineer background. Some members of Guardia Civil, especially those with Basque or Republican background, have even joined the militias to carry the fight against the authoritarian regime of Madrid."
BAS.5.a:0 "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world."
 
BAS.6.t:0 "Resurgence of Herri Kirolak!"
BAS.6.d:0 "With the independence of Basque country secured, the Basque people have entered a new golden age of culture, marked by rapid linguistic development and increased popularity of traditional Basque sports. Herri Kirolak, or rural sports, are a set of various different competitions and traditional tasks that over time have turned into tournaments showcasing mastery of different crafts and athletic merits. Almost all of these sports can track their origins back to the two ancient Basque professions, those of baserritarras, farmers, and arrantzaleas, fishers. Probably the most famous of these sports are Harrijasotzaileak, stone-lifting, and Aizkolaritza, wood chopping.\n\n In Harrijasotzaileak, a stone of immense weight must be lifted by the contestant, and the lift is considered complete once the stone is balanced on his shoulder. Two contestants usually compete on which one can perform more lifts. With Aizkolaritza, the contestant must balance on a log while chopping apart tree trunks as fast as possible, with the one chopping the most in a certain amount of time emerging victorious. Various other sports exist, some even involving animals and humans or just animals, as is the case with Ahari topeka, ram-fighting, where two rams are goaded to fight each other in an arena not too dissimilar to those used in bullfights. For the ram to score points, it must strike the opponents head or horns, with eight hits granting the ram a victory. To aid the animals in these fights, they receive a different diet from a normal ram, usually containing some mixture of beans, apples, red wine, carrots or egg yolk. \n\nSome sports have even attracted international interest after our independence, as the Scottish tourists visiting our lands have been intrigued by our sport, Lasto botatzea, bale tossing, which they claim to be similar to their sheaf toss sport. A cultural mission has been launched to visit Union of Britain and see if our best bale tossers can compete against Scottish champions. The Basque rural sports are often also used as a gambling venue, with bidders choosing their champions and often earning considerable sums in national level races. For the champions, the most common reward is txapela, Basque beret of considerable prestige, and the word champion in Basque, txapeldun, literally means one with beret."
BAS.6.a:0 "Glory to the txapeldun!"

BAS.7.t:0 "Revival of Basque Cuisine!"
BAS.7.d:0 "With our hard-fought independence, the Basque culture is blooming, no longer as shackled to the developments in Spain and gaining increasing influence from France as the Basques there cross the border to visit their western compatriots. Alongside art, music and sports, the Basque cuisine of Euskadi has exploded in popularity, partially because of overwhelming patriotism but also simply because contacts to Madrid and other areas of Iberia are severed. That make it harder to get ingredients for dishes that haven’t traditionally been made here in Euskal Herria, and thus the revival of traditional Basque cuisine is partially practical in nature. The greatest driver of this cultural revival have been txokos, a Basque culinary society that takes place in mainly male-dominated spaces, where Basque men gather to prepare and enjoy local meals, as well as innovate on recipes and ingredients.\n\n Basque cuisine is, as can be expected of such a seafaring people, highly seafood-oriented, but as with all of Iberian and Mediterranean food culture, meat from cattle and pork are very present in the form of chistorra sausages, tripotx lamb sausages and Pamplonan chorizos as well as various steaks grilled slowly over charcoal. Still, for the vast majority of Basques, the salted cod, or bacalao, would be the dish closest to heart given how many different local dishes, from omelettes to bacalao al pil pil the ingredient has made its way into. It is also a cornerstone of the service performed by another great influencer of Basque cuisine, the sagardotegi cider houses. Serving the world famous Basque cider Sagardoa, alongside salted cod omelettes and various other dishes, these establishments have a rather curious habit of serving their cider. During an event called txotx, the cider is served from a large barrel through opening the lid so the cider shoots out and it is then caught by the diners with their glasses, as low as possible so the cider gets as much air into it as possible. Then, meals are continued until the next txotx. For more socializing meals, many Basques swear on the pintxos, which are traditionally eaten as light snacks in taverns and bars.\n\n However, while sagardotegi and pintxo bars are still the most popular places to eat in Euskadi, more traditional restaurants have been gaining ground given the popularity of Nicolasa Pradera’s Andia restaurant. Pradera, a famous Basque chef, published her hit cookbook ‘La cocina de Nicolasa’ in 1933, which circulated throughout Spain and greatly enhanced the popularity of Basque culinary quirks. With our cuisine culture in full ascend, Nicolasa has been asked by the Basque government to tour some other European culinary capitals in order to promote our culture in foreign countries as well, though given the gathering warclouds over Europe, this may be a difficult task to achieve."
BAS.7.a:0 "All this talk is making me crave a pintxo right now."

BAS.8.t:0 "The Question of Carlist Militants"
BAS.8.d:0 "The Basque republic is only taking its first moves in the world, but already our politicians are preparing for any threat to it, both external and internal. While we are unlikely to be invaded by the French or Spanish as such conflict could spark a much larger war, there are forces within Euskadi that could easily destroy our fledgling democracy. The Carlists, traditionalist monarchist rivals of the the Spanish Alfonsist monarchy, have made it clear many times that they consider liberal democracy an aberration of nature. While they participated in elections during the Republic era and even briefly allied the Basque Nationalist Party, it is clear that coexistence with the Carlists will be strained at best in our new republic. Many within our government urge the use of Ertzana against them, as their powerful Errekete militias could attempt a coup against our government. However, there are others, especially among EAJ and Aberri, who consider them a necessary evil against Spanish or French tyranny, as after all, the Erreketes helped us defeat the Spanish bastards during the struggle for independence. Ultimately, the decision lies with the lehendakari."
BAS.8.a:0 "Useful or not, we can’t leave nothing for chance. Crush them!"
BAS.8.b:0 "They’re Basques just like we, let them be."

BAS.9.t:0 "Traditionalists Crush the Republican Movement"
BAS.9.d:0 "The Basque government had grown too used to their powerful position in the separatist territory. This has proven to be a catastrophic mistake, as Carlist Erreketes marched to Bilbao today armed to the teeth, completely dismantling what little defences had been established. Commanded by a Carlist militant and politician, Antonio de Lizarza Iribarren, the Errekete militias clashed with socialist and republican militias, but given the completely unexpected nature of this attack, the Basque defences were overwhelmed and their men slaughtered in a series of street skirmishes. The government buildings were swiftly encircled and the entire separatist movement dismantled, although as of now it remains unclear whether Lizarza is acting on behalf of the Basque traditionalist militias or the wider Carlist cause. Whatever the case, the Basque republic has been destroyed as quickly as it began, forced to kneel under the boot of reactionary traditionalism."
BAS.9.a:0 "Viva Cristo Rey!"

BAS.10.t:0 "The Spanish retreat!"
BAS.10.d:0 "Despite the seemingly impossible odds, we have managed to defend our independence, and the dogs in Madrid have retreated. Whatever plots they had planned for us, they have been thwarted, and it appears as though the Spanish have given up on trying to reclaim their lost territory. We must remain vigilant for future invasions, but for now, we are free to pursue our own destiny!"
BAS.10.a:0 "Basques are free at last."

BAS.12.t:0 "Addressing the Chronic Firearm Shortage"
BAS.12.d:0 "While we have plenty of rifles and pistols thanks to the raided arsenals of Guardia Civil and Spanish garrisons, it is becoming increasingly clear that we lack many of the things needed by a modern army. Rifles and pistols may be good for skirmishes with police or light border-guarding duties, but what we need is artillery, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank weapons to hold our own against a conventional military force. Our stock of machine guns is equally woeful, with only a few old MG 08s bought from Germany and some Chauchats smuggled in from France. The government has created an extensive weapons purchase program for the next year, where artillery and ammunition will be purchased from German Krupp plants and machine guns from Bohemian Zbrojovka Brno, as these manufacturers are known to be best among their peers."
BAS.12.a:0 "Weapons to make the earth tremble!"

BAS.13.t:0 "Fresh Off the Forge"
BAS.13.d:0 "The Weltkrieg showed just how terrifying weapons machine guns, and to a smaller extent, submachine guns could be. The cumbersome Villar Perosa and then ubiquitous Sturmtruppen weapon MP-18 both demonstrated the usefulness of a small, man-portable weapon in pistol calibre, and after the advent of the submachine gun, this design type has only produced newer and more lethal weapons. However, under the rule of Madrid’s kleptocrats, Spain never really invested into those weapons, the closest alternatives being the Astra Model 904 copies of the Mauser M714 Schnellfeuer carbine, which sold in massive orders on the Chinese warlord market. However, even those were more simply conversions of semi-automatic pistols into automatic weapon role, and thus Spanish submachine gun scene was simply at its infancy. Now, however, that is about to change, as the Star Bonifacio Echeverria, a local gun manufacturer, has received an order to put their Si-35 submachine gun model into full scale production. While not particularly novel in design, the submachine is expected to be a rather reliable future mainstay of the Euzko Gudarostea. However, a small controversy has emerged around the design, as it uses the Spanish 9x23 millimetre cartridge. Basque nationalists have argued that using a round designed by the maketos is unacceptable, which has exasperated the designers as these nationalists demand the weapon to be converted into 9 millimetre Parabellum instead."
BAS.13.a:0 "Largo was originally a Danish design anyway, let them shout."

BAS.14.t:0 "Military Melting Pot"
BAS.14.d:0 "The Euzko Gudarostea, as it stands, is a hodge-podge of different militias, former soldiers of Guardia Civil and Spanish army, and even some Carlist rebels who joined us out of shared disdain for the Madrid regime. The army currently has men from Basque nationalists, socialists, communists, anarchists and republicans and Carlists alike, and tensions are inevitable in such settings. Much work must be done to forge the gudaris, as these new fighters for the preservation of Euskadi have started to be called, into a proper coherent fighting force, and settling disputes of ideological leanings have to be addressed as well.\n\n Thankfully, general Antonio Ortega, who switched sides from Spain to ours during the revolt, has been reorganizing the units in a way that seeks to avoid conflict between the ideological extremes. Similarly, to forge an unified soldier identity beyond party politics, much work has been done to create a culture around the military. The use of Eusko Gudariak, a soldier song written by José María de Gárate, has been touched up by Captain Alejandro Lizaso Eizmendi after our experiences during the war against Spain. Now, the song has developed into a rallying cry that Basques, regardless of ideological divides, can cling onto, and as a tool of patriotic propaganda, it has proven superior to basically any other. Hopefully, we can forge a military that is loyal to Euskadi alone, not to ideological demagogues of any direction."
BAS.14.a:0 "Goazen gudari danok Ikurriñan atzean!"


BAS.15.t:0 "Ikusi Mendizaleak!"
BAS.15.d:0 "When the war came to Euskadi, the mendigoizales were some of the first Basque patriots to answer the clarion call, and armed with simple hunting rifles, pillaged Spanish guns and at times, even just home-made incendiary weapons, these brave men held the line when the Ertzana was being assembled. Consisting of the youngest and most fiercely patriotic Basques, they were born out of a Basque tradition for mountain hiking, and in the past had been utilised to recruit and train Basque nationalists clandestinely up in the Pyrenean mountains. Most of this training had been done by Euzkadi Mendigoxale Batza, a populist separatist movement masquerading as a hiking organization. \n\nThe vice-president of EMB, Mikel de Alberdi, would tragically be the first casualty in our fight against the maketos, falling to the bullets of Carabineros in a skirmish during the first days of the war. While his sacrifice was not in vain, it did severely impact EMB’s inner structure. Given that the organization is struggling internally, we could offer to integrate its fighters into the army properly. While integrating a political organization into our military is obviously questionable, these men are known to not question the decisions of the Basque government, and their skills in mountaineering are simply unmatched by those of our regulars, militias or the armies of our rivals. With this integration, we could have a proper mountaineering units, ready to defend our mighty mountain chain and to provide terrible headaches to our enemies as they try to dislodge these brave gudaris. The EMB organization will remain as a civilian thing as well, but strictly under civilian leadership, with its members hopefully later joining the military mountaineers once they enter their national service. "
BAS.15.a:0 "Begiak zabaldurik, bihotza erretan!"

BAS.16.t:0 "Ertzana Formed"
BAS.16.d:0 "With the declaration of war probably coming in the next few days, as Castile scrambles to return its imperialist rule over Euskadi, we must quickly create a force to oppose this enemy. While the Euzko Gudarostea, a proper Basque army, is being raised to respond to the Spanish threat, we must utilize the freshly created police force, Ertzana, as a temporary military force. Ertzana is primarily a special police force, with many of its men operating out of fast Riley cars and others using motorcycles to quickly move from town to town in the service of justice. However, the largest component of Ertzana is the force on foot, actually the force behind the title of this unit, and it has been described as one of the most modern police forces in Iberia. Recently, the press reported that ‘Ertzana’s foot battalions were formed by young men of a certain culture, more than 1.75 m tall, both trained in the handling of weapons, rifles, machine guns and tear gas. their silver insignia on their berets and their long blue coats, they looked magnificent.’ \n\nThis new addition to the Basque Public Police is seemingly received well by the populace, and even the motorized sections have received praise from the press, with one journalist reporting that ‘they had even better physical presence than those of foot police. With their brilliant brown leather jackets, riding pants, flat caps and leggings, they impressed the people of Bilbao the same way as their revolvers’. Clearly, their presence will be an amazing propaganda victory for us, but before we celebrate this new force too much, the grim reality is that they are still primarily a police force and thus only time will tell if they can face the Spanish army in combat without it ending in a disaster for us. "
BAS.16.a:0 "Let us pray that they succeed."

BAS.17.t:0 "Gudari Eguna"
BAS.17.d:0 "The dream of Sabino Arana and countless other Basque nationalist throughout the ages has been achieved, and the oldest people of Europe now stand proud, our independence secure and our enemies humbled. And this liberty, brought by responsible governance and the mighty arms of Euzko Gudarostea’s loyal soldiers, is the most sacred material value for the Basques now, for never again shall we be ruled by Spanish, French or any other imperialist overlord. The highly disunited and disorganized roots of Basque army are gone, with only a professional military of elite soldiers remaining to stand watch over our tall mountains and serene valleys. Through patriotism, fraternalism and bonds forged through fire, the Basque gudaris, different as they might be ideologically, are all just as committed to the cause of seeing our beautiful state retain its sovereignty. Whatever difficulties the world tosses our way, the Basque army shall weather them in its new form. As such, a new national holiday has been formed to celebrate those that fell during the terrible days of the independence war, and those that still serve the nation, putting their lives at the line to keep our people safe. Gudari Eguna, Warrior Day, will be held on ninth day of November, and among other holidays, a national memory service will be held for the martyrs of the independence war, including a rifle salvo to honour their passing. Euskadi shall never forget her heroes, nor the price they paid."
BAS.17.a:0 "Gora Euskadi, gora Gudari!"


BAS.18.t:0 "Aberri Eguna!"
BAS.18.d:0 "Aberri Eguna, or Fatherland Day, is not a particularly old tradition, but one that has captured Basque hearts in the short timespan it has been celebrated. Originally, such a concept was coined by Sabino Arana, but it was put into action by EAJ in 1932 to commemorate his death. The day is a celebration of all things Basque, from the traditional music to local sports and foods, but most importantly, the Basque cider. Sabino believed that without direct and swift action, Basque culture and people would be dissolved into the greater Spanish whole, but the continued tradition of Aberri Eguna proves every year that these fears were unsubstantiated. All around Euskadi, people gather to celebrate, families meet no matter the distances, religious communities pray for the nation, political parties hold rallies to commemorate the father of the republic and the newfound independence. Most interestingly, the celebrations are not merely confined to Euskadi itself, but our Basque brothers over the Pyrenees hold their own parties, defying the French encroachment on Basque culture year after another. Yet another year of free Euskadi passes, and every year meets us with more prosperity!"
BAS.18.a:0 "Bring out the cider, to Euskadi!"
BAS.180.a:0 " Bring out the cider, to Euskadi!"

BAS.19.t:0 "Choosing the National Flag"
BAS.19.d:0 "The Basque flag, Ikurriña, is among our most distinguishable symbols, but given the long history of Basques dating back to prehistoric times, there have been many flag designs that could equally work as a national symbol. We can, of course, simply keep the Ikurriña, but there are those who prefer the Arrano beltza, Black Eagle, a symbol commonly attributed to the Navarrese king Sancho VII. While not quite as prominent as the beloved Ikurriña, it is favoured by many Basque nationalists, especially those who don’t feel right about using a flag designed by the Arana brothers. Aberri nationalists on the other hand have proposed using the original design made by Luis and Sabino Arana, the father of Basque republicanism, which is a slightly different variant of the Ikurriña. This flag, however, is least likely to be accepted due to its minimal design change."
BAS.19.a:0 "Ikurriña stays!"
BAS.19.b:0 "Arrano beltza looks nice!"
BAS.19.c:0 "Go with Arana's original design!"

BAS.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Basque National Elections"
BAS.20.d:0 "For the first time in our history, we are able to hold independent, proper elections made up only of Basque parties. There are 4 parties present at the elections.\nThe left-most party to participate in the elections is the reorganized ELA union, seeking to advance the agenda of Basque workers through parliamentary means. While not as popular as the more moderate EAE, they stand a chance of winning as the other socialist and syndicalist parties of Euskadi have boycotted the elections.\n\nThe second left-wing party is the EAE, led by Tomas Bilbao Hospitallet, who, like the EAJ, believe in a strong Basque state, but disagree with the overt clerical attitude of EAJ. While nowhere near as large as the EAJ, EAE is growing increasingly more popular as the internal conflicts of EAJ cause it to haemorrhage supporters tired of the constant bickering.\n\nThe behemoth of Basque politics is the EAJ party, a strongly Catholic nationalist conservative party. EAJ has dominated the political scene of Euskadi ever since its inception, and their strong links to tradition appeal many within the new state. However, they are staunchly republican, and thus have drawn the ire of many Carlists. Their moderate views into future relations with Spain have also caused them to lose support of the more radical Aberri faction.\n\nThe last but not the least is the radical independence-seeking wing of EAJ, Aberri, led by the brother of legendary Basque nationalist Sabino Arana, Luis Arana. Arana disagrees with the moderate and conciliatory view the EAJ holds of Spain. Arana’s party believes that only armed preparation and vigilant eye on the border will keep Euskadi safe from the imperialists of Madrid, and while they agree with EAJ in economic matters, a compromise between these parties is hardly realistic.\nThe elections have already started in Euskadi, with the general euphoria of independence slightly easing into more temperate state as the population prepares to settle their political differences through the ballot box."

However, given the influx of various left-wing actors in the region after the ban of Spanish trade unions, our movement has undergone a rapid transformation into something completely different. We have proven the naysayers wrong, providing an alternative to the bourgeois democratic parties of our rivals. Our new movements respects Basque tradition and faith as much as any other, but we have merged these century-old ways with the worker’s unity and equal treatment of our new socialist ideology.

The situation over the Pyrenees is more dire, as despite all the sacrifices our Basque brothers made during the Weltkrieg, the Syndicalist government has forgotten them and even cracked down on their Catholic traditions. This cannot stand, we must establish a program to deliver aid to them and perhaps even fuel separatism among our kin over the Pyrenees.

While their wholly anti-clerical nature is anathema to the Basque nature, we still believe that the power of the church should be combated somewhat. As such, lehendakari Belauste has proposed a set of reforms aimed at lessening the church’s power, especially on education. This has been explained as a means to lower strain on the clergy and to free their resources for more religious purposes.\n\n We have also decided to remove the requirement for party members having Basque surnames, as whether elements of our society want it or not, the Spanish immigrants can’t simply be kicked out. This is likely to boost our numbers even further, as the xenophobia of the Aberrianos and jetzales of EAJ is likely to push many Spaniards to join our party.

New programs will be formed to teach our history to the youth and Basque nationalist art and literature will receive generous governmental aid. The Euskaltzaindia institute is to be completely funded by EAJ, with even our rivals in other parties supporting this initiative. San Sebastian, the culinary capital of Euskadi, will receive further state investment to turn it into a veritable beacon of Basque culture, and last but not least, the sports of Euskadi are to be supported, both in the form of the traditional pelota court sports and the national favourite, football, a sport many of our politicians greatly enjoy playing.

Aberrianos, and all of Euskadi owe so much to him, and in his legacy must this new state be built. Just like Arana, many within our ranks are disturbed by the amount of maketos, Spaniards, in our lands, taking jobs from honest Basque workers. But while that issue must be dealt with in time, first we must complete those ordeals that Arana set in motion so many years ago, such as the creation of a Catholic, traditional but republican state in Euskadi, the revival and standardisation of the Euskara language.\n\n We will also reclaim Arana’s family home from the moderates of EAJ, who have squatted there for too long, and it shall be turned into a proper memorial of Euskadi’s greatest hero. His works will be published in schools, the national flag will be swapped to his original design country-wide, and city streets will be renamed in his honours. The time has come to celebrate the Father of Euskadi, and Aberri will do his legacy justice through our new mandate!"

BAS.34.d:0 "Ever since the Basques separated from Spain, the question of what to do with the Spanish minority remaining here in Euskadi has caused friction in the newly established parliament. Today, this matter seems to have received its final conclusion, as Aberri militants march across Basque country gathering those of Spanish origin, often at gunpoint, and load them into wagons and lorries. Any protests or bargaining are only met with silence or at best, an order to stay quiet. The convoys of trucks snake their way through the rural backroads, hoping to go mostly unnoticed by the local Basque population, and eventually arrive to the Spanish border.\n\n There, the civilians are ordered out of the vehicles and sent marching over the border, rifle barrels of their guards pointed at their backs. While this massive expulsion of perceived foreigners will likely be met with great hostility from the other parties, notably EAE, the aberzales believe that as long as Spaniards live on our soil, we are in a constant risk of espionage and Madrid’s agents undermining our independence. Aberri has done its duty to keep Euskadi free in the future as well, and while in the short term this will be a major blow to the nation diplomatically and economically, the party leadership believes it to be a necessary evil."

Like us, they fought their colonial overlords and overthrew the shackles of oppression, but they have gone to great lengths to revitalize the Irish culture and language, something we aspire to do. Similarly, the Irish have remained faithful to their Catholic faith, and they have worked diligently to build republican institutions from the ashes of the British imperial administration. While the future of Ireland is unclear, at this moment they stand as the greatest inspiration to our movement, a brotherly nation with similar values to ours, and we must set out to strengthen this bond both economically and politically through diplomatic avenues.\n\n May our countries blossom to their full potential, as partners in the anti-imperial struggle, in a world dominated by colonialists and greedy profiteers. Lehendakari Arana has even proposed a proper state visit to Dublin to meet the Irish government and discuss furthering co-operation between our two nations."

BAS.50.d:0 "It is no secret that Euskadi houses a significant mineral wealth. In fact, the reason for so many Spanish immigrants in our lands is directly because of these resources, as the industrial revolution and its consequences brought them here to mine them for the Spanish imperial machine. While in their usual manners, the Spanish managed to completely mismanage these mines, our administration has decided to not repeat their embarrassing blunders.\n\n The company Mines de Rodalquillar has received considerable investment from both the government, international companies and local private entrepreneurs, and the prospects of discovering great gold veins inside the Pyrenean mountains looks more likely by the day. Already, gold has been mined from various excavation sites, and although small in general output, the sudden increase in discoveries is making eyes turn, worldwide, towards the Euskadi economy."

As such, we have expanded government subsidies to the company Ferrocarriles Vascongados, which has long served as the railway company of Basque Country. With the connections to Spain mostly severed, the company saw heavy losses initially, and only the rapid actions of the government kept it afloat. However, as more and more goods made in our country locally are shipped off into the world, and the industrial boom of Euskadi is in full swing, their locomotives work day and night to keep up with the demand.\n\n Many Basque citizens are also happy with the company’s growing focus on passenger transport, as their railway network expands to fit the demands of industry and agriculture, these new connections can also be used to ferry civilians between cities and towns. The chugging sound of the Euskadi-class steam locomotives speeding through the rolling hills and meadows of our nation is becoming more and more familiar by the day."

As a major war seems more likely to break out in Europe with every passing day, the company has stated that it cannot rely on export models and must prepare with local production, even if only to supplant the existing stock of carriages and engines they possess. Our ministers seem eager to purchase these new locomotives too, and have placed an order for a handful of them for testing in military operations."

BAS.60.d:0 "The Basque republican movement was thought to have eclipsed the Carlists in popularity at the dawn of the 3rd decade of , but recent events have proven these assumptions critically wrong. Today, the constitution of this pathetic republic was destroyed, and the most prominent leaders of the left-wing Republican parties were confined in house arrest, waiting trials. There are some, especially among the Aberri ultranationalists, who could be converted to see the righteousness of our cause, but most of the republicans shall stand before the judge for their actions. While the monarch’s council has urged caution when dealing with these nationalist and separatist fanatics, as pushing them too far would likely cause an insurgency against our rule, we must weed out the most republican-minded and ensure that no liberal or socialist traitor will threaten our rule. The Basque Republic is dead, and in its place, new Navarre and eventually Spain will be built, one bound by tradition, faith, old laws and monarchist vision!"

In their inaction, they will doom Spain to face a war in the coming years, one that will destroy the very fabric of what it means to be Spanish.\n\n Thankfully, the fate of Spain is not in the hands of these incompetent buffoons. No, it will be decided by the hands of loyal Basque and Navarrese men, the patriot of True Spain, an immortal entity not burdened by the softness of Alfonsine monarchists nor the republican insanity. Navarre has for centuries resisted the liberal vermin, and in recent years, the socialist and syndicalist spawns of Satan, and for this it is one of the most beautiful and pure regions of Spain. We will begin the campaign to see this vision come to life, a Carlist Spain that will return the nation back to its roots. Our new realm is secure, and it stands as a testament to the traditionalism inherent in the Spanish nature, a province fit for the rightful king! It is time to bring this transformation to the rest of Spain, to end the humiliation of its people by false prophets and ideological serpents."

BAS.62.d:0 "Basque Country and Navarre have long been the very hearts of Carlism, serving as the strongholds of the movement in the Carlist wars, keeping both the pretenders of Madrid and their British allies at bay. However, while our controlled territories do host most of the Carlist patriots and loyalists of the true king, they’re not the only areas of Spain where Carlist cause was followed. In Catalonia, the movement gained ground especially in the rural areas, fighting back the hordes of godless anarchists. Areas such as Galicia, Asturias, Leon and Andalusia also had some degree of Carlist support, though not to the extent of Navarre and Catalonia. With our success at eradicating the socialist and republican elements from our nation, many Spaniards who in their hearts know our leader to be the true monarch of Spain have made the dangerous trek to our lands and pledged their allegiance to the Basque-Navarran Carlists.\n\n Prominent traditionalist politicians such as Manuel Fal Conde, José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino and the known integrist José María Lamamié de Clairac y Colina, have all arrived to Pamplona to pledge their support to the king, bolstering the Carlist government with their expertise. Military men such as Mario Muslera, José Enrique Varela and Ricardo Rada Peral have also arrived to fight alongside their comrades, ready to guide the Carlist armies to battle against their eternal rival. Funding has been provided by French nationalists and Portuguese integralists alike, especially in the form of weapons and ammunition, with Lebels and Portuguese Mauser–Vergueiros becoming a common sight among the Carlist requetes. With more loyal Carlists arriving every day to bolster our ranks, the day of the Reconquista draws nearer, the cowards at Madrid probably trembling at their boots as the entire regions of Basque country and Navarre gear up for war. Once the last Carlist patriots arrive, the great march southwards shall begin."

BAS.63.d:0 "As the Basque republic fell, many socialists and syndicalists fled to the countryside and hillsides to continue fighting our traditionalist militias. Their influence has been crushed for the most part, but among the urban folk of Bilbao and San Sebastian, it still lingers like a phantom of a terrible past. To fully purge our nation from this menace, many members of AET, the youth section of the Carlist movement, have proposed that we recreate the Sindicatos Libres union. Back in the days of the Catalan separatist movement, Sindicatos Libres became an important force to counter these separatists and their anarchists allies, working as strikebreakers and streetfighters to squash the insolent rebels. \n\nNot only were they a great example of a truly patriotic worker, who puts the idea of an unified and stable Spain over a few more coins in his purse, the Sindicatos Libres movement was, at its core, highly Carlist. While many of the lower ranking members of the movement were simply interested in the protection of religious values, for the leadership Carlism was very important, and while the influence of that waned as the movement grew less important on the Spanish scene, the movement could serve as an inspiration for the creation of a similar union here. With the help of these Sindicatos, we could push back against the reds, lowering their numbers as joining our union would keep pious workers from being radicalized by the socialist scum, as well as providing another means to fight strikers and other slackers whenever they attempted yet another action to hamper our rule."

BAS.65.t:0 "El Valiente Requeté"
BAS.65.d:0 "Erreketes, or Requetés, as they are more commonly known in Spain and its minority regions, are a militia unit dating back to the rise of youth movements in Spain at the beginning of 1900s, but while other youth movements of the time usually belonged to radical currents of liberalism, socialism or separatism, Carlist Requetés were always living life according to proper traditionalist values. What started as a group of young, reckless militants seeking to fight their ideological enemies on the urban sprawl of Spain’s cities. Inspired in part by the French Camelots du Roi, developed by our ideological allies in Action Francaise, the movement developed to have a dual purpose of being the propaganda organ of Carlism as well as the muscle needed to reign in Carlism’s many opponents.\n\n While requetes weren’t the only militia force of Carlism, with the Sindicatos Libres unions also helping cull the numbers of revolutionary anarchists immensely, Requetés soon developed to be the most prominent Carlist organisation of violent purpose. When the movement grew into more action-oriented direction, and as Carlists began to plot the end of the Spanish republic and the Alfonsist regime that followed it, the Requetés became a veritable force on their own, getting formal training from traditionalist-minded officers and soldiers, armed with weapons smuggled from Portugal and Austria by like-minded radical Catholics.\n\n The movement also left the many urban centres of Spain, focusing more on the rural common man, more willing to defend the sacred values of Carlism than the more liberal-minded urbanites who have long ago turned their backs on both God and Eternal Spain in the pursuit of false gods of capitalism and syndicalism. The Navarran and Basque provinces provided the best grounds for the expansion of Erreketes, and many pious Basque men joined the brigades of Erreketes to fight for the one true king of Spain. Now, we must expand this movement to finally strike the killing blow on Alfonsists and republicans alike, and restore Spain to its eternal glory!"

BAS.66.t:0 "Reforming the Ikastolak System"
BAS.66.d:0 "As we now hold full control over Basque Country and Navarre, the King’s council has obviously been mainly focusing on martial matters in anticipation of the upcoming reclamation for all of Iberia. However, a weak state is built upon distracted governorship, and thus we must focus on those matters too that do not matter so much for the military side of things but are sorely needed to legitimise our rule over these lands. The matter of education has been raised by especially those members of the Carlist organisation who are born Basque, and they have questioned whether the king will uphold his promise to honour the Basque rights to autonomy, especially in regards to the Basque language. Ever since the independence of Basque Country, the republicans greatly expanded the ikastolak system, a network of schools around the nation that primarily teach in Basque. They were originally created in protest of the secularisation of schools under the republic and the aloof attitude of Catholic schools towards the Basque language question in local schools. While they’re not under the rule of the church, these institutions are just as pious as those run by the clergy, and Catholic faith is as present there as everywhere else in Basque country. With just minor adjustments to their program, such as the reintroduction of clergymen and church officials such as deacons into the teacher roster, we could convert this inherently Basque form of education to better serve the Carlist cause and make sure that schools are not only educational in sciences but also in morality and piety. Obviously any mentions of the Euskadi republic and its government, other parties and rest of the devious liberal ideas must be eradicated as well, to be replaced with the celebration of Carlist cause, patriotic education to children and youth alike, and teaching of the history of Basques as an integral part of Spain, unique but not separate thanks to the excellent fueros system!"

BAS.67.t:0 "The Promise of Fueros"
BAS.67.d:0 "Carlism, a support for a traditionalist, absolute monarchy, could probably appear to be an odd ideology for a region of fiercely independent-minded minorities to support, but the reason the cause of Carlos V and his descendants could always count on Basques and Catalans was the support for fueros, local autonomy and respect for ancient laws that the Carlist kings promised to honour. Despite the three Carlist wars and numerous smaller conflicts to depose the Alfonsine line to the throne, which all ended, more or less, in a disaster, Catalonia, Basques and to some extent Asturias and Galicia, remained fierce supporters of the true king’s cause. As we prepare for the fourth and final Carlist war, it is only fitting that Basque country, to many the very cradle of Carlism where it was nurtured and prepared for the great struggles ahead, is our very headquarters. With the pious, loyal and determined sons of Bizkaia, Gizupkoa and Navarre on our side, we can finally push out the rotten corpse of the Alfonsine lineage, burn its carcass to the ground and return the throne of eternal Spain to its only worthy owner. And for this, the Basques can return to their lands, safe in the knowledge that thanks to their sacrifice, their rights, old laws and beloved Catholic faith will never again be threatened by the tyrant, socialist or liberal, ever again. Given this proclamation, many of the more traditionalist-minded Basque republicans have seen it fit to simply join our organisation as well."

While in the wider Iberian peninsula those guerillas sow chaos and anarchy wherever they go, here in Euskadi the ranks of local CNT-FAI are mostly fishermen and dock workers, who only really engage in union activity in rare cases of upper management ineptitude. The ideological basis of this group is debatable, and while even our own Catholic union doesn’t engage in dialogue with this small movement, it is clear that they are mainly isolationist cell. However, there are certain firebrands within our ranks that see their very existence as affront to God, and demand that we wipe out these pitiful bands before they help the Spanish or French in destroying us.

In a series of running battles, where the army attempted to retreat to Bilbao, the military was served reversal after another when the black and red-clad assailants proved their mastery over terrain and improvised weaponry alike, decimating the enemy morale.\n\nUpon reaching the capital, however, they were greeted by the final attack of the syndicalists, and in this swift but brutal battle, the government was overthrown. Revolution arrived to Euskadi, and the black and red banners rose to towards the sky over Bilbao. The overconfident members of the government had been shown the errors of their ways, and many were captured while on the run towards the Spanish border, a nation they had despised for so long.

The outpost nestled between the Pyrenean mountains hardly ever saw travellers due to its remote location. After the recent independence of Basque Country, it had been manned once more in preparation for any Communard infiltration attempts. A guard patrol was sent out on a routine route throughout the valley, where to the guard’s surprise, they found an abandoned horse cart. As they began to inspect the derelict vehicle, three unknown figures rushed out of the bushes nearby and managed to strike the soldiers down in the ensuing melee. Two of the attackers tied the guards up by the wagonside while a third man swapped his worker’s overalls to the uniform of the guard. After a brief conversation the small group split, with the uniformed man heading back towards the outpost and the two others disappearing into the woods once more. The outpost guards had already settled into a drowsy routine, bored after so many weeks of sitting idle in these mountains. As they saw a man return, in similar uniform to theirs, the sentry simply panned towards him once with the searchlight and told the approaching man to state his business. The man replied that he had come back to visit the toilet after an uneventful patrol, and the sentry, not suspecting foul play given his boredom and general lack of things happening up here on the Pyrenean mountains, was about to pass him by. However, for a split second, a thought crossed his mind that something about the man’s voice had not been the same as those in guard duty."

The anarchist flags, hoisted over the buildings of the mighty coastal city, waved lazily in the wind. The city had been caught in a lethargic mood, as the final celebrations of the CNT-FAI victory had  died down and the fishermen turned anarchist revolutionaries realized the scope of their new duties. Already many among their ranks had simply deserted and returned home, leaving only the most ideologically motivated or opportunistic to pick over the carcass of the Basque Republic’s institutions.\n\n The cracks of the anarchist movement were beginning to show, their loose confederation of separate enclaves of coastal unionism buckling under the weight of managing a territory the size of Euskadi, and factionalism was running rampant. Now, the most capable anarchists had decided to gather a congress to nominate a temporary leader, who would act as a mediator for the various factions within the movement. As the ragged militias and union bosses gathered at the city hall of Bilbao, still covered in bullet holes from the revolt, their congress could begin.\n\n However, mere moments after the nomination of Justo Garate Arriola as the mediator, a sharp cry from outside the city hall captured everyone’s attention. The few anarchist guards left outside the main hall opened fire on something, but the grunts of pain soon revealed them to be on the receiving end of bullets. The anarchists gathered in the hall attempted to react, when bullets began peppering the building and hand grenades flew into the space from both inside and outside the building. The sound of explosions made the few city blocks around the city hall tremble, and in the five minutes the exchange of fire had taken place in, the leadership of Basque CNT-FAI was utterly wiped out.\n\n A man in his mid-30s, dressed in the simple monos overalls of Iberian workers, entered the room, flanked by bodyguards in similar suits. The only distinguishing feature on their clothes was a symbol similar to those used by the French Jacobins over the northern border. The leading man, Jesús Larrañaga observed the carnage for a second before marching across the destroyed hall to the podium and addressing his men, members of the Partido Comunista de Euzkadi. In a room littered by corpses, where blood slowly seeped into the wooden planks below, the Jacobin revolution of Iberia had begun."

Jesus Larrañaga had spent the last days leading the men on storming actions or figuring out the logistics of the Jacobin takeover, using every drop of strength in his body to make his dream of a Basque country under the Jacobins a reality. But as news arrived of a French ship docking at the Bilbao harbour, his enthusiasm rekindled. A company of hardliner Jacobin Basques and Spaniards, trained in French Basque country, stepped into the dock, armed to the teeth with French rifles, submachine guns and pistols. After them, the true Red Lehendakari arrived.\n\n Leandro Carro Hernaez, one of the original founders of the now defunct Partido Comunista Española, had been exiled to France by the royal regime almost two decades ago. Now, his men had returned, and instead of the Leninist-inspired communists of the 1920s, the EPK would bring true Red Jacobinism to Euskadi and beyond. As Hernaez congratulated Larrañaga on his victory, the younger man handed over the reins of the new state to Hernaez. With their leader finally in the country itself, the build-up of Euskadi into something greater could begin, unshackled by reactionary superstition and harmful nationalism."

BAS.75.d:0 "In the start of the 1900s, the fire of communism still burned in the hearts of the ideologues of Europe, simply waiting for the moment to finally overthrow the capitalist controllers of the worker. But when the Bolsheviks were defeated by the reactionary monsters of Russia and their Kerenskyist lapdogs, and the French syndicalists toppled the bourgeois republic, the world was set on its course, that being the ideologically soft syndicalism. Here in Spain we have already seen the error of this ideology, first when the Spanish anarchists conceded defeat in the elections and once here in Euskadi when we decapitated their pathetic little movement in one fell swoop. While our French Jacobin brothers still consolidate themselves in preparation to one day overthrow the Syndicalists there, we shall begin our own work with utmost speed.\n\nThe Spectre of Communism has not haunted Europe for decades, indeed, some would say that it was properly killed off or paralyzed when the Bolsheviks were crushed. But the new “Workers’ and Peasants’ Government”, hastily assembled by Larrañaga, Hernaez and secretary-general Juan Astigarribia has decided to revive Marxist-Leninism here, to once again haunt the lands of Iberia. The party will be organised as a vanguard one, and it will integrate the few unions that Bilbao and rest of Euskadi boasts. Euskadi Roja, the party newspaper, shall be utilised to its fullest extent to educate the Basque people with our policies. The Spectre shall return, revived by Basque hand."

BAS.76.t:0 "The Marxist-Thorezists Arrive"
BAS.76.d:0 "As we solidify our control of Euskadi, it is becoming increasingly clear that while our administrators and politicians are enthusiastic, our ideological basis outside of the government’s highest levels is subpar. People are confused and angry about our religious policies, low-level officials are trying to carry out our economic and social policies but lack the understanding to do this properly, and the union representatives tend to slip back to syndicalism if left unchecked. But thankfully, we are not alone. Thanks to our short distance to the French border, Jacobin agitators and militants have crossed the border with the help of PCF sympathisers. With their help, EPK party members are getting far further in their studies and should soon be ready to properly lead our people. The military aid given by French Jacobins such as Jules Dumont has been invaluable to our efforts to build a centralized military of professionals to replace the militia-like Ertzaña. The French experts have helped us build the first building blocks of a proper intelligence agency. They’ll also help us kickstart a program that would replace the outdated Catholic beliefs that Basques hold with a proper Cult of Reason. While we do have our grievances with PCF on some matters, such as the fate of French Basque Country, it is undeniable that without their help, we couldn’t have leaped forward as quickly as a party and society. Already many Basques are proving that our revolution was necessary as they enthusiastically adopt our viewpoints under the guidance of our French allies. Many young party members, such as the promising Jacobin Youth member Ramón Ormazabal, are already quickly rising through the ranks, and will provide the party with young blood for the years to come."

BAS.80.t:0 "The Question of French Leadership"
BAS.80.d:0 "With Basque troops now storming the few last military holdouts in Madrid, the defeat of the Castilian imperialists is certain. Spain lies in ruins, the rump holdings of Castile decimated by concentrated Basque advance, and with the Jacobin banners raising over Madrid, Seville and Gibraltar, the last hopes of Spanish chauvinism have been shattered. As Jacobin boots crush the last remnant of Spanish backwardness, a very real question has now risen to many lips inside our realm. The population of Euskadi is far too small to completely occupy Spain, and our intention from the start was to unite with the other communist cells in Iberia to share power in a popular federal republic. Now that former Spanish lands are united, however, many Spanish leaders have proposed holding an inner-party elections to determine who will lead the new republic.\n\n The Basque leadership has agreed to this offer, and five candidates have stepped up to contest the incumbent Leandro Carro Hernaez for the chairman’s seat. Probably the most prominent of these challengers is Dolores Ibárruri, famously known as La Pasionaria, being a strong advocate for feminism and Marxist-Leninism, and also of Basque origin. Another Basque communist veteran is Vicente Uribe, who became well-known for both his propaganda skills during the war, and the laws he pushed to help the situation of farmers and rural smallholders, earning him much fame among Spain’s rural folk. Representing the youth wing of the Jacobins is José Cazorla Maure, leaving the shadow of his mentor Carillo. His reputation is somewhat hampered by the harsh crackdowns he performed during the war against Spain, though his connection with the radical youth wing of the party has earned him many votes. \n\nThe candidate of our armed forces is Enrique Lister, known for being a talented militia leader during the war, and while he runs a platform of increased military control and militarisation, he is known to exhibit some internationalist and agrarian tendencies as well. Finally, the dark horse in the race is unquestionably Andres Nin, a follower of the Trotsky doctrine of internationalism and leader of Izquierda Comunista de España, he is the only candidate to not be part of Spanish communist party.

BAS.81.t:0 "The Question of French Leadership"
BAS.81.d:0 "As Basque troops raise the Jacobin banners over Parisian roofs and the dust settles, many Communards can hardly believe their eyes. Yet with every passing day, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the Jacobin rule is here to stay, with the Communards exhausted from their fight against the Germans and their country ruined from the two front war. However, as the Basque commune’s leadership has announced its dedication towards creating an unified Ibero-French Jacobin Commune, many French Jacobins are now demanding that we honour our commitment to the cause and remember their sponsorship of our regime so many years ago by allowing their representatives to also compete for party leadership.\n\n Should we agree upon their request, the candidates most likely to win would be either the leader of Parti communiste français, Maurice Thorez, or the representative of the National Jacobins faction, Jacques Doriot. While Doriot follows an ideology quite different from the Red Jacobinism which Basque Jacobins subscribe to, he is nonetheless an important figure of French Jacobinism and thus not easy to sideline.\n\n Both Marcel Cachin and  Jacques Duclos have also announced their bids for the leadership, Marcel Cachin banking on his reputation as one of the founders of PCF while Duclos has apparently decided to step out of the shadow of Thorez as one of the main ideologues leading PCF in the period between Weltkriegs. While these two candidates do not appear to have as high a chance of winning the nomination, they still lead the last candidate to appear by a wide margin, that being Andre Marty. Being a former Jacobin, his expulsion from the party led him to Basque country, and without his help our revolution may very well have been thwarted. His aggressive and brutal methods have earned him quite a bit of infamy in Iberia, and while his chances of victory are slim, many fear the reign that he would bring to the new union of Iberia and France."

BAS.82.t:0 "Curious Flotsam"
BAS.82.d:0 "As dusk enveloped the sky over Biscayan coast, one of the last fishing trawlers was slowly chugging towards the shore, returning from a successful day’s work. As the piers of San Sebastian came into view, the sky began to darken in turn, and a torrential rainstorm began to churn the sea below. So close to the shore, the boat had no real danger, but the boat crew spotted an even smaller vessel that would not be as lucky, should the storm continue. A man in a tiny inflatable dinghy was closing towards the city, his boat tossing and turning in the raging sea, and the boat’s captain made the decision to help him. As the fishing vessel closed in to save the man, his dinghy capsized, plunging the old man into the water. Only the quick actions of the deckhands saved his life, and soon he was dragged out of the water. The deckhands were treated by a bemusing sight, as an old, bearded Asian man with a clear dogged determination burning in his eyes stared back at them.\n\n The man’s backstory remained a mystery as the Basque fishermen did not speak any of the languages the man did, although they could understand few of the French words he said. With this limited communication, the fishermen took him to the local headquarters of the Basque Communist Party, where a few of the officials could converse with the stranger in French. To their surprise, the man claimed to be Ho Chi Minh, one of the founders of Parti communiste français and a hero of the Indochinese resistance struggle. Hearing of our bravery against the Spanish imperialists and the following struggle to reclaim the Jacobin homeland, he decided to return from his self-imposed exile and announce his bid for the leadership of French and Iberian Jacobins.\n\n The news sent the new union of communist states into a frenzy, as the leaders of Spanish, Basque and French Jacobins are struggling to come to grips with the peculiarity of this proclamation. Nonetheless, many Basques sympathize with Ho Chi Minh, finding his anti-colonial struggle more relatable than the French state that up until recently held very anti-regionalist views. The strange arrival also holds quite a bit of legitimacy due to his role in forming the PCF, much to the dismay of French Jacobins."

BAS.111.t:0 "The One True King?"
BAS.111.d:0 "A crowd of stone-faced men had gathered on the inner yard of the Biscayan Assembly Hall. Their gazes were directed at the large tree located in the middle of this space, an oak which vibrant leaves sheltered the crowd from the scorching sun. This tree, the only one on the yard, was no mere decoration, but the Tree of Gernika, a symbol of continuation for the entire Basque people. While the original tree had died in 1860, this successor known as the “son", has stood in Gernika ever since, and traditionally both Carlist claimants and Spanish kings swore to uphold the civil liberties of the Biscayan people here. Today, however, the Lords of Biscay, a council of highly influential members of Basque society, have gathered to discuss a matter of utmost importance, the claimants of the crown of the newly proclaimed Carlist Kingdom of Navarre. \n\n Before the Lords, the claimants or their representatives have arrived. The most legitimate, at least by mainline Carlist reasoning, is Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza, who has become the primary candidate for Carlist succession in Spain and wields considerable influence in the movement. However, Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón has also gathered a considerable movement around him, due to the connections he has with Austria, and his strong opposition to socialism. \n\n Many Basques have their reservations regarding these two claimants, however, as the new independence has made them extremely wary of the Spanish. As such, they believe that a more controllable monarch would be ideal for the Basque Carlists. Some have pointed out that as the new kingdom claims the title of Kingdom of Navarre, we should honour the traditions of that kingdom as well, mainly the lack of the Salic Law. With the absence of this law, it would be possible to crown a queen as well, and some have pointed to Carlos Pío’s mother, Infanta Blanca, as a possible candidate. While this would cause us to cut ties with Spanish Carlists, it would give us far more leverage as Basques. Ultimately, the decision lies in the hands of the Lords of Biscay "

BAS.111.e:0 "Is there a possibility we may have missed someone?"

BAS.112.t:0 "The One True King?"
BAS.112.d:0 "As the Lords of Biscay inquired on a possible fourth claimant, one of the men in the crowd cleared his throat and spoke. He claimed to be a representative of the crown of Two Sicilies, currently ruled by king Ferdinando III. While the house of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is very distinct from the Spanish Bourbons of both the Carlist and Alphonsist lines, they too are descendants of Charles III of Spain, and the envoy of the Sicilian crown expressed his interest to potentially unite the two realms again. While this notion was immediately protested by all three Carlist claimants present, the Basque members of the crowd seemed far less bemused by this suggestion. \n\n While their claim to rule is feeble at best, it could provide a solution to the succession dilemma and also separate Kingdom of Navarre from direct Spaniard rule. However, this would likely cause a massive uproar in the Carlist ranks, and produce a schism of such scale that the movement could potentially tear apart. Nonetheless, Two Sicilies is a powerful ally and a legitimate kingdom with actual land that they control, not a landless claimant like the Bourbon Carlists."

BAS.153.d:0 "After our rebellion succeeded and the oppressive rule of the city-dwellers came to an end, it has become more than clear that the various fishing hamlets and small settlements of the Biscayan coast are not exactly the most ideologically homogenous. While our movement has its roots in the CNT-FAI activity of San Sebastian, particularly the Los Justicieros group, but for most of our members, anarchism is merely some lofty ideal and the real reason for their continued support lies in the unity provided by the movement. However, given the fact that we are now in control of this vast territory, there are those within our movement that demand a more concrete ideological basis with which to build our new freed communes with.\n\n While the lands of the Basque country boast many riches and factories, a model similar to France or Britain is simply not sustainable on our resources, but this does not mean that we cannot look to other forms of syndicalism instead. Given the naval tradition of the Basque peoples and the many sailors within our unions, we could adopt the identity of red raiders, pillaging capitalist shipping as it passes by our territory, and playing our part in the global struggle while also gathering means to eventually reach the level of development our allies boast. This option, however, is bound to cause many traditionalists still present in our lands to protest or even revolt. \n\n There is, however, another option. Given the pious nature of the Basque people, and as such, we could seek to adopt the Christian syndicalist theories into our movement to gather support from even those who were previously members of Aberri and EAJ.

While we are certainly more willing to take action to secure the independence of Euskadi than the soft liberals of EAE or the moderates of EAJ, Aberri has honoured its democratic mandate and elections will run their normal course. However, given that our political platform has gone through a crash course of reforms and corrections, the party leadership has questioned lehendakari Arana on how this new course should be reflected in the next elections. \n\n Of course, we could retain our Christian democrat program, but there are other options as well. One posed by the more moderate wing of our movement is the adoption of the so-called National Democratic model, very popular in Poland and Czechia. Now that we have proven our dedication to democracy, we could use this ideological model to create even greater unity among the Basques and foster the golden era of Basque identity. However, the other option is a form of conservatism often seen in nations like ours, that have recently gained independence. This National Conservatism focuses heavily on the creation of a highly homogenous and unitary state, unified by ethnicity and piety. Given our stance on Basque cultural supremacy and traditional societal values, this would fit the movement well."

The Basque National Action has grown into a true mass movement, and the Popular Front strategy has paid off immensely. But now that our movement has shifted away from small-circle theorists into proper action, a new question has risen. Where do we go from here? So far the middle class nature of our leadership has made the movement more liberal than socialist in many ways, but going forward, we may have to distance further from the centre to forge an identity of our own. \n\n The Basque society is very conservative in nature, but perhaps our movement is just what is needed to break the Basques from their outdated stupor and finally bring Euskadi to the 20th century. The Radical Progressivist ideas could provide a framework for us to work with in achieving this goal. \n\n Other option would be to bring socialist rhetoric to the toiling masses of Basque farmers, who have up until recently primarily supported Aberri, Carlists or the Basque Nationalist Party. By adopting more agrarian policies and a populist approach, we could possibly turn this large population to our side, although it would likely also greatly affect the direction of our reforms."

BAS.156.d:0 "Few expected us to win in the elections, and even fewer expected us to remain faithful to the values of Basque democracy. However, despite our radical stances, we have done so, and now hold considerable sway over the politics of Euskadi. This has, however, meant that as our union becomes more like a political party, the ideological basis becomes increasingly more muddled. There are those within our ranks who say we have betrayed the basis of the union. While such naysayers are merely a minority, they are a vocal one, especially considering the union leader Manu Robles-Arangiz is part of this group,   and they are increasingly growing into a nuisance. As such, the union-party leadership has proposed that we outline our policies in preparation for the next elections, and adopt some elements of socialist model within the democratic framework, without completely abandoning our ties to Catholic unions. \n\n We could simply continue under the Paternal Socialist model, which is possibly the most right-wing socialist model around. Many would argue that it’s barely even socialism at all, but if we add a slight red tint to our rhetoric and policies, it might just be the compromise needed to adapt the Spaniards and Basques to the new rule. \n\n However, another option is up for consideration. French syndicalists, disgusted by the violent and revolutionary rhetoric of their comrades, created the ideology of yellow syndicalism under Pierre Biétry, which aims to achieve the goals of workers through cooperation and negotiations by the organized labourers and the owner classes, similar to corporatism but with a far larger focus on the labour side itself. This would probably be the most stable decision to follow, as the ideology is clearly socialist in nature as the Communards allow it to operate, while also being moderate enough for the conditions of Basque country.”

So great were their skills that even the great nations of the world looked up to Basques to learn to hunt the behemoths of the sea. In fact, so great was our need to pursue the prey that many historians, for example the Belgian scientist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden has claimed in the last century that Basques could have found America while chasing whales, reaching the shores of Newfoundland as early as the year 1372. Two centuries later, however, the Basque whaling in that area lead to our whalers completely dominating its whaling trade, as Basques set up dozens of whaling stations there and named the territory Grandbaya. The amount of goods that could be extracted from these glorious beasts of the sea, ranging from the ever-increasingly profitable whale oil to the bones and fat of the creatures.\n\n Whales became the cornucopia of Basque colonialism, and while other nations focused on gaining land and assimilating natives to steal their riches, Basques instead simply set up trading camps and whaling stations to continue the great hunts. However, our presence in Newfoundland was important to the region, as the local natives developed a pidgin, a simplified language incorporating elements from local language and that of the foreigners to ease communication when neither side knew enough for dialogue in just one language. The Algonquian–Basque pidgin, or Souriquois, became an important means for communication between Basques and the three native tribes they met relatively often, the Montagnais, Algonquians and Iroquois.\n\n Now, the region has long been lost, as our hunters became too good for their own good and the whales grew rare, leading to the abandonment of the colonies. The British, seeing free real estate to set up their colonies, stole this land and have left it mostly idle. As nationalist fervour grips our small nation, many call for a reclamation raid to be launched, to grant us the territory and drive out the useless Canucks and Britons from that land which is rightfully ours!

BAS.226.d:0 "Basque migration to the new world was surprisingly large, with the Spain’s colonies housing large amounts of people from the provinces of Bizkaia and Gizupkoa as the Castilian colonialist project rolled onwards. Many simply wished to improve their economic prospects or sought adventures, but to others, especially in the 19th century, immigration was the only option. Many Basques who had supported the Carlist cause in the many Carlist conflicts of that century sought the newly independent nations of South America as refuge from the fury of the Spanish royal family. This lead to the development of large Basque minorities especially in nations like Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, and especially in Chile, the Basques evolved to become a rather impressive minority among Chilean elites. Many important statesmen of Chile’s history. Chile’s presidents Federico Errázuriz Zañartu and José Manuel Balmaceda, as well as great military leaders such as Bernardo O'Higgins, who freed Chile from Spain, and Manuel Baquedano, who fought for Chile in the War of the Pacific, all came from Basque roots. Even within the new socialist government, the rising star Salvador Allende of the more moderate Chilean socialists can track his lineage right back to Euskal Herria. As such, this ancestral bond has made many Chileans travel here to free Euskadi, for some to reunite with old families and for others to simply see the homeland once more. As this ancestral bond has been reunited, many Basques have even started talking about a possible unification with ‘Txile’, given how great of a connection our nations have.

Iparralde’s sons bled and died on the fields of Verdun, fighting for a country that cared little for them and for a people who did not speak their language. This blatant disregard for our kin cannot stand, as the Communards have not done anything to truly help our people and the Nationalists in Algiers have shown their true faces with their handling of the local population.

Even with its flaws, the Basques supported the republic immensely, given that it finally offered a degree of autonomy to us and the other Spanish minorities. However, the following four years of military rule and one-party dictatorship under puppet Alfonso XIII and his lackeys in Accion Popular certainly helped the republican ideals gather strength in Basque country, especially as people remembered the liberated feelings of 1931. Now that Basque republic has stabilized and become a true beacon of democracy, liberty and equality in the Iberian peninsula, the time seems ripe to return to the heartlands of Spain and restore the Spanish republic once more, either under our rule directly to never suffer Castilian dominance again, or as a supervised state to ensure that the tragedy of Sarjurjada never occur again."

While the Pact succeeded for a time, its true legacy was perhaps the recognition that Spanish regionalist parties got for their participation in it, and the lead-up to the alliance saw connections deepen between Galicians, Catalans and Basques as all sought, to some degree, greater autonomy or even complete separation from Spain. These connections would reappear when the royalist restoration happened and Spain was plunged back into the repressive regime of the monarchy.\n\n The Alfonsists gall to maintain the dictatorship after coming so close to a civil war was the final straw, and thanks to the connections between Basques, Galicians and Catalans, the dream of our three republics freed from Castile became true. To honour this alliance, the Basque government has discussed the possibility of forming an alliance with Catalonia and Galicia, and this has been highly supported even by opposition parties. However, others have also called for the Basques to invite nations with significant Basque diaspora to join the alliance. Aberri party has also stressed that we should invite Ireland to join as well, given the long ties between us and the Emerald Isle."

BAS.234.t:0 "The Curious Case of Caucasia"
BAS.234.d:0 "After the independence of Euskadi and the reestablishment of the Euskaltzaindia academy for the research and development of the Basque language, Euskara, the increased international attention placed on our little nation has caused some language theorists to contact Euskaltzaindia. Most academics were mainly just interested in our development of the Basque language, and research methods utilized in piecing together a coherent “Standard Basque”, as this project has now come to be known as. However, while most were simply related to the methodology of our academic struggle, two researchers stood out due to their theories. An Austrian researcher from the Viennese Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum, Robert Bleichsteiner, and a doctor from Yale University in United States, Morris Swadesh, have both approached us on the topic of Georgian language.\n\n Given that Georgia earned its independence after the Weltkrieg, their importance in linguistic study has increased, and now scientists of linguistics like Swadesh and Bleichsteiner have theorized that among various other small Native American and Russian languages, Georgian could potentially be related to the Basque language. This has been a controversial topic among the scientists of Euskaltzaindia, as many are just claiming it to be pseudo-scientific speculation, others are complaining that such theoretical fluff distracts from the real task of reforming Euskara to a proper standardized unit, and yet more say that it’s degrading to Euskara’s uniqueness as a time capsule of old European languages.\n\n However, some of the more nationalistic-minded Basques, especially those who support the Aberri movement, have claimed that we should reunite with our linguistic brothers, now that we finally have one, especially to protect them from the chauvinistic Russian empire. More moderate politicians have instead argued that we should send a delegation to Georgia to discuss this matter and perhaps even set up a Basque-Georgian friendship society if they are receptive to such advances."

BAS.236.t:0 "The Black and Red Flag Flies Over Madrid!"
BAS.236.d:0 "Rising to greatness from the humble villages and fishing hamlets of the Biscayan coast, the Basque anarchists have carried the torch of anarchism to victory over the oppressors of Spain, hammering the final nail into the coffin of Castilian imperialism. However, the Basques certainly did not expect a victory of this magnitude, and thus the organization is left reeling with the massive repercussions of controlling so much territory. A transitional period has begun, where the Basque anarchists must maintain some semblance of order to avoid a reactionary takeover, and thankfully many Spanish, Catalan and Galician anarchists have joined our movement in support to help slowly transform Iberia into the paradise of anarchism it was always meant to be.\n\n However, this transitional period means that we must select a nominal leader to deal with the fallout of the war. Once the stabilization has been achieved, elections will be held within Spain’s syndicalist-aligned groups to establish a truly syndicalist democracy, but for the time being we must quickly select a candidate with the administrative skills to fulfill a shift towards a commune structure similar to France and Britain.\n\n Buenaventura Durruti is the current favourite of the Basques, supported  because of his actions in the Basque country in the early 1900s inspired the Basque anarchists during our long campaign. Another potent option is Cipriano Mera, a militant anarcho-syndicalist known for his many antics during the reclamation war and a very hardliner stance on the ideology. Contrasting Mera is Juan Garcia Oliver, a Catalan anti-colonialist syndicalist also known for being willing to cooperate with other left-wing parties.\n\n Less likely candidates to win are José Díaz Ramos, Angel Pestana Nunez and the dark horse candidate Ramiro Ledesma. Diaz is known to support a more centralized model of syndicalism, and is known for sympathizing with the communists of Spain at times too. Angel Pestana Nunez is the father of the Partido Sindicalista, a more moderate strain of anarcho-syndicalism that sought to legitimize the party in parliamentary stage. He now supports limited cooperation with Spanish republicans too. Finally, the leader of the infamous JONS, Ramiro Ledesma has appealed to be able to run in the temporary leadership elections, due to his cooperation with CNT-FAI in the reclamation war. Known supporter of national syndicalism, Ledesma has allegedly moderated his platform somewhat but the truth remains to be seen should the radical ideologue manage to seize the people’s vote."

BAS.237.d:0 "During the bleak years of Pistolerismo, right before the coup of Primo de Rivera, Spanish anarchists were living their glory days. Enemies circled around CNT-FAI like jackals looking for an easy meal, and the revolutionary fervour of the French Communards washed over Spain like a flood. The noble fighters of FAI smashed apart yellow unionists, police thugs, right-wing paramilitaries and republican collaborators alike, confident that the events of France would happen here too. The red and black tide reached even the distant shores of Biscay, usually sheltered from such ideological developments by the sheer reactionary nature of Basque society.\n\n A group of radical anarchists led by Buenaventura Durruti founded the Los Justicieros group in the coastal city of San Sebastian, with the eventual goal of assassinating king Alfonso XIII. While CNT-FAI had spread into Basque country somewhat even before the founding of Los Justicieros, the actions of that group helped cement the arrival of anarchism to this wayward territory, alongside some Basque agitators seeping in from over the French border. Given their importance to the anarchist movement in our small territory and the lack of real ideological direction that Basque anarchists have, the local council has decided to create a memorial to the actions of Los Justicieros. While they may have been a small footnote in the history of Iberian anarchism, to us they were the spark that started a true fire."

However, after the fall of Bilbao and the capitalist republic propped up there, San Sebastian was also taken over by the anarchist masses, and while Bilbao remains the central hub of governance, San Sebastian has quickly evolved into the heart of the anarchist revolution. Workers in the typical monos attire are joined by the roughly dressed seamen and dock-workers in the streets of the crimson city, offices and shops are converted into working places or public houses and the many casinos of the city, famous as hubs of international intrigue during the Weltkrieg, have been socialized to instead serve a societal function. Some are turned into giant warehouses, others are used as educational facilities and others are simply turned into housing.\n\n The city’s ancient walls are once again converted to defensive purposes, as members of the confederal militias stream into the walls during training and guard duties. The city, which during the Carlist wars had stood as the sole liberal settlement in Basque country, now serves as the headquarters for the transformation of entire Basque country into modern, decentralized and thoroughly communalist territory free of capitalist oppressors, reactionary religious fundamentalist and Spanish colonialists. The cultural capital of Basque country shall serve as a beacon of true revolution in Iberia."

BAS.239.d:0 "Euskalduna, one of the pearls of Basque industry, was first created by Sir Ramon de la Sota, one of the most celebrated Basque nationalists alongside Sabino Arana, one of the few Spaniards to be elevated to knighthood of the British Empire by George V and also the man behind EAJ’s adoption of more pragmatic positions in Spanish politics. While his list of credentials may be long, most importantly for our anarchist cause, he founded the large shipyard Euskalduna and employed many of our dockworker supporters as well. After he passed in 1936, heartbroken to see his shipyards dwindle in orders due to the terrible global economic situation, the company has been somewhat derelict with the chaos in Spain causing issues with its leadership. The plutocrats running the company ran the second our revolution came, as can be expected of the exploiter class, but the shipyards themselves still exist in all their glory. We must reopen them to business, churning out civilian and military ships to further the goal of a global revolution. With Euskalduna giving us destroyers, corvettes and torpedo boats to work with, we could seek to raid the capitalist shipping passing by our shores as well. The gifts of these shipyards will be great, and they are only expected to increase now that the people creating the goods are also in charge of the production."

BAS.240.d:0 "Euskadi has seen a sharp rise in unionism after the declaration of the Basque republic, but for the most part, the Solidarity for Basque Worker, ELA, union has stolen most of the spotlight. Given the ban on Spanish parties and unions, many workers flocked to the banner of ELA, and while this did turn the union more towards socialism than it had ever been before, it was still mainly a Christian union and exhibited dangerous corporatist principles. However, now that the Basque anarchists decapitated the snake of capitalism and crushed the bourgeois republic, elements of left-leaning ELA have approached us in hopes of helping the revolutionary cause. While the differences between our coastal syndicalists and their mainly urban, Catholic workers are great and will keep our movements apart, there is no reason to not seek a closer alliance. The alliance with ELA will make it easier to not upset the Catholic workers quite as much, while it also allows our anarchists to influence them more towards true socialist thinking, free of corporatist bootlicking of the ownership class. The alliance will likely prove to be a complex and cumbersome one, but many of our leaders, such as Santiago Aznar, a recent convert from PSOE, view this coalition as a good alternative to simply ruling alone and shouldering the ire of the Catholic population. It will mean some concessions to our highly anarchist thinking, but in the end it will likely prove to be more beneficial to us."

BAS.241.t:0 "Anarchism in the Confines of Basque Culture"
BAS.241.d:0 "One of the most defining features of Spanish anarchism is the fervent and unyielding anti-clericalism of its supporters. Given how intertwined the church has always been with Spanish politics, and how Catholic clergy has been a major influence to reactionary movements such as Renovacion Espanola, Carlists and Accion Popular, it’s not surprising how the anarcho-syndicalists of CNT-FAI have developed a distaste for the church. While our nascent movement has mainly adhered by the guidelines of the wider union, with matters of faith the leadership of our movement remains divided. Some of the more fervent revolutionaries want to completely eradicate the church control over here in Basque country, but most followers of anarchism here are either indifferent or against such measures. While our supporters may follow the tenets of anarchism usually, here in the heartland of Euskadi even the anarchist remains a rather pious man.\n\n As such, even if it means deviating from rest of Spain, we must make sure that the church is not threatened from performing their religious duties. At least here in Basque country, the clergymen are members of the society mingling with the common men, not some paternalistic figures holding masses and berating their followers without interacting with them otherwise. Of course, action must be taken in case the priests and other functionaries of the faith attempt to spread reactionary sentiments in Basque society, but for now we must foster good faith between our movement and the religious institutes."

BAS.242.d:0 "In the early hours of a beautiful new day in the Biscayan coast, a vessel flying the colours of Internationale chugged towards San Sebastian. On its deck, a group of journalists observed the jagged rocks rising from the sea, ocean foaming at the feet of these colossal cliffs. Dotted between these behemoths of nature’s might, small hamlets with long piers defied the harsh elements, their harbours housing many rugged ships with sturdy nets and sharp harpoons. For many of the journalists and members of both British and French intelligentsia, the thought that these small hovels and forgotten villages had burst alit the flame of revolution in Iberia was simply incomprehensible. Compared to the organized and urbanized mass revolutions of France and Britain, these unassuming houses seemed fit to only house reactionary peasants. \n\nYet as the ship finally sailed to the dockyard of San Sebastian, the representatives were greeted by waving flags of black and red, mixed in with some ikurrinas and black eagle flags. The home of Basque revolution, and the jewel of the Crimson Coast, exhibited just as much revolutionary fervour as their French and British comrades had done so many years ago, and while the Internationale representatives would very much come to learn the ins and outs of the new Basque society, their later reports to various press organs of the Internationale would always harp back to that initial dichotomy of the Basque revolution, as inspiration to movements just like theirs."

A direct vote has been organized by members of the council, giving everyone in the nation a voice in the matter, and two candidates have emerged the least likely to win. Santiago Aznar, a former member of PSOE before it was disbanded by the Republican government, has switched to syndicalism due to his long career in union politics, and now seeks to utilize his talents as a union organizer to ease the transition towards true anarcho-syndicalism, though with his peculiar tint of Basque nationalism aimed at preserving Basque values despite the anarchist nature. His rival is a famous professor Justo Gárate Arriola, who, despite stints with Basque ultra-nationalism, has slowly drifted towards left-wing positions, and now sees potential in the revolution of our syndicalists. While not particularly ideological, he seeks to develop Basque syndicalism and anarchism slowly, allowing it to mature at its own pace, in alliance with the other left-wing groups of Basque country."

Catholicism is such an integral part of the society that to detach the Basques from it would likely lead to the end of the Biscayan society as a whole. But to our leaders, Hernaez and Larrañaga, there is no alternative. As the French did after the Revolution of 1789, the Basques must adopt a Cult of Reason. Like the French, we will free Euskadi from the Catholic Church which bounds it in tradition and backwardness. As the original Jacobins did, we too shall guide humanity to Liberty and Truth, worshipping Reason above all else, so that mankind can finally leave the darkness of ignorance and step into the light of Enlightenment. The fate of our people must not be determined by some delusion of a higher being, but by our hand alone, the replacement of gods found within us all. Cult of Reason guides us into the future, where the common man has all the tools for improvement right inside his own head. Just as the marvellous and timeless ideas of Marx, Lenin and Thorez lead us into a more egalitarian and just society, so does the Cult of Reason show us the path to a society where reason, intelligence and logic triumph over superstition. The ill-begotten gains of the Church that it has ripped off the hides of the working man for centuries shall be seized and repurposed to help the common people, the priests shall be re-educated to forget their delusions and the Basque people will uplifted from their kneeled prayer to stand tall as rational actors, not as servants of gods."

While this mostly does not affect us, as we crushed the republicans and anarchists already, the question of what to do with the Solidarity for Basque Worker union remains. At the moment many within their ranks have clamoured to join our party, but as the union was originally a Catholic organization under the control of the Nationalist Party, it harbours a lot of dissidents that could seek to harm our movement if left unchecked. Our Minister of Agriculture, Vicente Uribe, has proposed integrating the union as is into our state apparatus, and then weeding out the nationalists and Christian saboteurs from within. While costly politically, it would allow us to kickstart a party-controlled union without the slow process of creating one from the ground up and recruiting members. However, some within our party, Chairman Hernaez included, support the renaming of the union after we absorb it into wider Jacobin framework. Hernaez has proposed naming it the Sindicato de Vizcaya, after his first trade union as a young communist, Sindicato Metalúrgico de Vizcaya. It would better indicate the union’s role as the single, uncontested union of the EPK. Some, however, desire that the original name is kept as a slight concession to traditions."

But through suggestions, manipulation and coercion, the Jacobins have dragged this forgotten part of the world to the civilised era, throwing away its neo-feudalist yokel. But just as one corner of Iberia is saved from the madness of conservatism, other parts of it sink even deeper into this disgusting rot. The Kingdom of Spain has abandoned any notion of serving its people and instead just feeds its bloated carcass of caciquismo and nobility with the fruits of the downtrodden classes’ labour. Just like the Jacobins of 1789 destroyed the behemoth of reaction, and just like the revolutionaries of the 1920s tried to topple the old order, we, Jacobins of Euskadi, will march to Madrid and burn down the old world. The monarchist snakes will be decapitated, the bourgeois worms stomped under our bootheels, and the false socialists will be either made to convert to true revolutionary action or disposed of.

The Jacobin order is absolute, and thus the revolution is mere weeks from being finalized with the conquest of Spain. However, the party line is far from clear, with the inevitable factionalism setting in. The party struggles from the presence of two factions, the majority supporting Hernaez’s more mainline Jacobin line where much of the focus is placed on the scrubbing of Basque and Iberian culture and tradition from our new order, instead placing emphasis on internationalism and Jacobin culture instead. However, nationalists such as Larranaga have argued that this will uproot our movement from the people and simply drive the people into rebellion against our rule. While Hernaez holds the majority and could easily shut Larranaga down, his minority is strong enough that it could easily make the party politics a hellscape. As such, the majority of Hernaez must decide whether to force the nationalists to give up on their delusions or attempt to reconcile with this difficult stubbornness."

The new ways of war require coordination between boots on the ground and eyes in the sky, but thankfully, we already have an ace to look up to. Robert Iribarne, a promising Basque pilot who had been training in secret over the border in French Basque country alongside other Basque nationalists and socialists, made the perilous journey back to Basque country by a bicycle when the war was declared. Joining the few pilots our tiny nation had in an improvised air field north of Bilbao, these daredevils were given three Avia BH-33 fighters from Czechia, originally ordered for Republican Spain and then stashed to Basque country in anticipation of a possible Communard attack once the Republic was crushed.\n\n These Avias, hastily painted in Basque colours, would form the basis of the Basque air force during those terrible days of the independence war, and Iribarne proved to be our best pilot, engaging multiple Spanish aircrafts during the conflict and earning the title of ace even as his two comrades in the othe Avias were tragically lost during the battles. His eventually tally of five aerial victories would include two Spanish Hart bombers, who got lost on a bombing raid to Gernika and were pounced upon by Iribarne, a Macchi M.18 sea plane that was directing the fire of Spanish navy during their raid of Bilbao, his only fighter kill, a Letov Š-231 that had been attempting to strafe the Iron Ring of Bilbao, and finally, a Hispano-Suiza HS-34 scout plane directing an attack on those same fortifications. While Iribarne was able to emerge unscathed from the war, his plane did not, as the stress of those constant flights was too much for it after such a long storage and his fighter, nicknamed Irrintizina, was scrapped. However, as the Basque government is looking into buying Dutch Fokker DXXI’s, it is more than likely that Iribarne will be one of our first test pilots for the new, and more capable, fighter."
