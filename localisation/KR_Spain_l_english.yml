### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."
POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the specter of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."
POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "General Fransisco Franco Bahamonde's widely noted charisma and uniquely Spanish machismo facilitated his quick ascension to leadership of the Acción Popular. Now Franco, as Spain's head of state, has the unenviable task of forging a broken nation anew. For such burden, none can deny that he is uniquely qualified."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "Miguel Cabanelles Ferrer, who commanded Spain's African colonial conscripts in the Rif war has risen to the forefront of Spanish politics through strict discipline and focus. He and his Falange Española, organised more like a paramilitary than a traditional political party, may be the only force capable of bringing some semblance of order to Spain."
POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_FRANCE_DESC:0 "Jaime of Borbón, second son of King Alfonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has managed the impossible with his coronation as King of both Spain and France. As King of Spain he rules as Jaime I, whilst in France he is known by the regnal name of Henri VI, but in everyday conversation many simply refer to him as King Jacques Henri."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."

### Ideas ###
SPR_memories_of_the_republic:0 "Memories of the Republic"
SPR_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "On August 11th, 1932, the Second Spanish Republic came to an end, but the Republic lives on in the hearts of many Spaniards. While many malcontents harbour Carlist or Socialist sentiments, many political moderates, especially among military officers, wish to see the end of the incumbent Spanish monarchy. The open defiance of even the centrist elements of Spanish Kingdom are ever present in their continued use of Republican party names, and what little support Accion Popular may have had before the coup, it is now truly gone unless drastic measures are taken to rectify the rapidly crumbling situation."
SPR_black_monday:0 "Effects of Black Monday"
SPR_black_monday_desc:0 "Spain, as a close partner of the German Empire, has experienced a particularly accute economic downturn. Such a crisis is sure to worsen Spanish political turmoil."

SPR_social_breakdown_desc:0 "The prevalence of radical ideologies and political violence in Spain has led to popular fear and individual isolation. Many are afraid to even interact with neighbours and old friends. No society can function in this fashion."

SPR_diplomacy_focus:0 "Diplomacy Focus"

SPR_carlist_proclaimation_desc:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma, known to his supporters as King Javier I, has issued a proclamation declaring the end of the reign of Alfonso XIII and requesting that Alfonso's supporters help peacefully facilitate Javier's \"Restoration\". While most of those loyal to Alfonso are unswayed by this announcement, some of the soldiers certainly seem to be fighting with much less vigour."

SPR_propaganda_focus:0 "Radio Madrid"

### Focuses ###

### Pre Civil War Focuses ###

SPR_strengthen_kingdom:0 "Strengthen the Kingdom"
SPR_strengthen_kingdom_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
SPR_focus_diplomacy:0 "Focus on Diplomacy"
SPR_focus_diplomacy_desc:0 "We must convene meetings with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI. With our crisis seemingly unresolvable, perhaps we can at least prevent complete collapse."
SPR_talks_with_CNT:0 "Meet with the CNT-FAI"
SPR_talks_with_CNT_desc:0 "We should meet with the CNT-FAI, Spain's leading socialist organisation. By establishing a dialogue and engaging their demands, we can hopefully dissuade them from open rebellion."
SPR_meet_with_xavier:0 "Meet with Javier"
SPR_meet_with_xavier_desc:0 "Javier, Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, seemingly desires nothing less than the throne itself. Through discussion and perhaps even concession, we hope to persuade him to abandon his claim, or at least refraim from insurrection."
SPR_plea_for_peace:0 "Plea For Peace"
SPR_plea_for_peace_desc:0 "Spain is rife with unrest, and with civil war seemingly inevitable, the people should hear directly from their king. Hopefully, King Alphonso's personal plea for peace can persuade at least a few Spaniards to abandon violence."
SPR_focus_economy:0 "Focus on the Economy"
SPR_focus_economy_desc:0 "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
SPR_construction_focus:0 "New Construction"
SPR_construction_focus_desc:0 "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
SPR_civ_production:0 "New Factories"
SPR_civ_production_desc:0 "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
SPR_new_jobs:0 "Jobs for the People"
SPR_new_jobs_desc:0 "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
SPR_repurpose_steel_mills:0 "Repurpose Steel Mills"
SPR_repurpose_steel_mills_desc:0 "Steel mills employ many in our nation and make up a vital part of our economy, however desperate times such as these call for desperate measures. Restructuring a few of the steel mills in southern Spain into more generalised factories may be enough to give us the edge if the ongoing tensions bubble over into full blown conflict, even if it may permanently harm the region's steel industry."
SPR_relocate_factories_seville:0 "Relocate Industry to the South"
SPR_relocate_factories_seville_desc:0 "If things in Spain do truly escalate into civil war, our government stands little chance of holding much north or east of Madrid. It has therefore been proposed that we preemptively move as much industry as we can to Seville, due to it being one of the largest urban areas in the nation and an area that will hopefully be far from the frontlines."
SPR_galician_tungsten:0 "Invest in Galicia"
SPR_galician_tungsten_desc:0 "With the situation turning dire, it seems time to already prepare for the inevitable. Galicia's untapped tungsten reserves are plentiful, and is likely to be isolated from any potential conflict within the nation. By focusing on establishing mines to extract this tungsten, vital northern munition factories will be much less restricted by resource constraints."
SPR_focus_military:0 "Focus on the Military"
SPR_focus_military_desc:0 "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
SPR_mil_production:0 "Increase Arms Production"
SPR_mil_production_desc:0 "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
SPR_mil_planning:0 "Review Our Leadership"
SPR_mil_planning_desc:0 "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
SPR_fortify_madrid:0 "Fortify Madrid"
SPR_fortify_madrid_desc:0 "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
SPR_army_of_africa:0 "Recall the Ejército de África"
SPR_army_of_africa_desc:0 "The Ejército de África, the Army of Africa, were fundamental to our success in crushing the native rebellion that rose up in the Rif. It seems unlikely that we will face further rebellion in the region in the short term, and so we are presented with the opportunity to recall General Franco's troops back to Cádiz to prepare for any insurrection on the mainland instead."
SPR_german_assistance:0 "German Material Support"
SPR_german_assistance_desc:0 "While the Spanish army may lack in tank divisions, our friends in Berlin lead the world in tank production and development. By petitioning the Germans to provide direct material support in the form of heavy tanks, we stand to have a significant technological advantage over the rebels, which will certainly aid us in restoring order in the realm."
SPR_rally_kingdom:0 "Rally the Kingdom"
SPR_rally_kingdom_desc:0 "Despite our efforts to preserve peace, civil war has broken out in Spain. Now is the time to rally those loyal to the king, to eliminate our remaining divisions and ensure our nation does not fall to radicals."

SPR_destabilise_kingdom:0 "Destabilise the Kingdom"
SPR_destabilise_kingdom_desc:0 "It is clear that we will soon see the end of Gil-Robles's regime and the ousting of his puppet king Alfonso. Instead of attempting to prop up the government any longer, attempts should be made to strengthen those who wish to bring an end to the old order and bring in a new age of Spanish prosperity."
SPR_focus_cnt:0 "Shatter Iberia's Chains"
SPR_focus_cnt_desc:0 "Capitalism has clearly failed the nation of Spain, and the people of Iberia as a whole. Through supporting the cause of CNT-FAI we may be able to eliminate the evils of capitalism in our nation and bring about a new economic system that will directly benefit the common people of the realm."
SPR_cig:0 "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra"
SPR_cig_desc:0 "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra, the War Industries Commission, has been established in Catalonia with the stated purpose of ensuring the country is ready for war. Secretly however, the CIG's real purpose is to militarise the areas of Spain most loyal to CNT-FAI in order to arm these revolutionaries in the event of a civil war."
SPR_roads_of_war:0 "The Roads of War"
SPR_roads_of_war_desc:0 "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
SPR_raid_police:0 "Raid Guardia Civil's Armouries"
SPR_raid_police_desc:0 "For a revolution to be successful, its revolutionaries must be armed to oppose those who wish to suppress them. By conducting raids on the armouries of the Guardia Civil, the revolutionaries of the CNT-FAI will be able to both arm themselves and help deprive the Kingdom's armies of combat equipment."
SPR_zaragozan_steelworks:0 "Expand Zaragozan Steelworks"
SPR_zaragozan_steelworks_desc:0 "Zaragoza is home to some of the largest steelworks in the entire nation, and as a result it is also home to some of the strongest unions in all of Spain. As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
SPR_factory_sabotage:0 "Sabotage the Factories of Madrid"
SPR_factory_sabotage_desc:0 "Despite Madrid being the heart of the Kingdom of Spain, many within the city also wish to see the end of the regime. With the aid of factory workers loyal to the socialist cause, we can organise a coordinated campaign of industrial sabotage as a prelude to the revolutionary uprising, preventing the use of any of Madrid's factories by forces loyal to the King."
SPR_focus_carlist:0 "The Righteous Cause of the Carlists"
SPR_focus_carlist_desc:0 "The failure of the Second Republic showed the peoples of Spain that the country will fall apart without the guidance of a strong monarch. These past four years of turmoil have also shown us that Alfonso's incompetence would result in him failing to get people drunk in a brewery, let alone guide them through crisis. We should instead offer our backing to the Carlist claimant to the throne, and hope that a more legitimate Spanish King will lead our nation forward."
SPR_northern_industry:0 "Industrial Expansions in Northern Spain"
SPR_northern_industry_desc:0 "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
SPR_defend_burgos:0 "The Stronghold of Burgos"
SPR_defend_burgos_desc:0 "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
SPR_kings_proclamation:0 "The Proclamation of the True King"
SPR_kings_proclamation_desc:0 "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."

If we petition our Portuguese friends for support, there is no doubt that they will provide to us as much as they possibly can."

It is up to us, the Spanish Jacobins, to drag our nation towards modernity by severing these malicious influences from the nation’s politics, through secularization of various state functions such as education, workers’ unions, and anywhere else that the Church could be using against us. Even if the process might be slow and arduous, and we might not be able to fully turn the nation towards the peace and progress that secularism brings immediately, our efforts at least will help clear off the Catholic reactionary taint that plagues our nation."

It is time to sweep away the corrupted elements of Partido Radical and approach our former comrades with a gesture of goodwill. They may not outright join us, but at least we can reignite collaboration and lead Spain towards a better future, under the united Radical banner.

The church has only been a lackey of the crown, and continues to spread its tendrils into places it was never meant to be in. We, young barbarians of Lerrouxism, will finally sweep away the primordial Spain, replacing it with a truly new, radical and enlightened form. Partido Radical may have undergone shifts in its policy for a long time now, and it is clear this direction may lead us to ruin, so it seems that going back to the roots of Lerrouxism is the way forward."

However, if we are to keep Spain together and not fall into a dozen regionalist revolts, we must make some concessions to the various minorities.

As we now hold the reins of the nation through the people’s mandate, we can implement certain policies in favour of the Catholic masses, as well as appealing to them through newspapers, posters, rallies and such, and highlighting the AP’s own radicalism and anti-democratic elements, such as their own Greenshirts’ actions against own young democracy.

The Pact of San Sebastián, which we were one of its signatories, was a noble but unfulfilled attempt at creating a truly equitable and equal Republic of Spanish peoples. However, now that we now held the reigns of power unopposed, it is time we fulfill, if not the promise of republican idealism, then at least the promise of a Spanish community of equal peoples within one nation, this time under a monarchy that will not trample on the rights of the many peoples of the nation."
SPR_Involve_Workers_In_Economy:0 "Guarantee Economic Democratization"
SPR_Involve_Workers_In_Economy_desc:0 "What is a nation without its toilers? Our workers are still excluded from the workings of the economy, forced to work in factories for the fat cats with barely a fraction of what they earn. Because of this, our nation’s workers have grown disillusioned, which the CNT-FAI and other radical leftists have exploited to the fullest. To help alleviate this, we will attempt to pass legislations to give workers direct participation within the economy, and attempt to send our civil servants to ensure the process of giving workers more control over the economic processes and planning. Hopefully this will dissuade them from the radical left’s agitation."

SPR_Parliamentary_Monarchism_desc:0 "Within the democratic system, our party is the only party to proudly proclaim itself to be a monarchist party, within the ocean of begrudging liberals who still held republicanism within their hearts. With this in mind, we shall appeal and rally the monarchist supporters within our nation that still hold democracy close to their hearts, and with the solidification of our reputation of loyalty to the democratic course while maintaining loyalty to the monarchy, we can woo all the remaining democrats who are unwilling to join other republican-inclined parties, to bolster our ranks and reputation."
SPR_catholic_unions:0 "Social Catholicism Over Syndicalism"
SPR_catholic_unions_desc:0 "In recent years, the anarchistic unions from the CNT-FAI have been rallying the workers, disillusioned and radicalized by our stagnant political scene and economy. To counter these radicals, we shall sponsor the creation of new Catholic-lead unions that can channel the energies of our working men in the right direction. In addition, we shall pass legislation in line with the Catholic precept of charity, such as the right to fair day’s pay, public healthcare, and so on. Hopefully these policies can help steer our pious working men away from the CNT-FAI and their ilk. We will begin work on integrating non-socialist trade unions such as Confederacion Nacional Catolico-Agraria to better suit this agenda."
SPR_Align_Radicals_and_Agrarians:0 "Woo the Radicals and Agrarians Firmly Into the Right"
SPR_Align_Radicals_and_Agrarians_desc:0 "So far, our control over the Kingdom has solidified our position as the leading force of the moderate democratic right within the nation. However, while we have a foothold in the rural regions, we have yet to fully control the electorate here, and furthermore, we remain a niche party within the urban electorate in Barcelona and BIlbao, where the centers of industry are. However, there are certain elements who are popular in these regions. First is Alejandro Lerroux and his Partido Radical, who is popular in urban centres and have been leaning closer to the right-wing despite starting off as a left-wing anti clerical party. While their nature would sound like they would be hard pressed to be in coalition with a Catholic-oriented party like us, they have been known to be ‘loose’ with their incentives, and with a few ‘material’ incentives, they can be persuaded to work with us. Second is the Partido Agrario, a minor monarchist conservative party whose agenda is similar to ours, but appeals specifically to the rural gentry and landowning classes. Because of their minor status, we can strong-arm them into our new right-wing coalition and potentially even absorb them, preventing other, more radically right wing movements from absorbing them, while bolstering our own popularity with the rural gentry. With these new coalition 'partners', we can create a broad dominant right-wing coalition to counter the worker dominated urban and rural electorates, which are strongholds of left-wing radicals of the various left-wing parties and organizations of the PSOE, CNT-FAI, Izquierda Española and so on."

To this, we shall organize our economy further through Corporatist lines, in which the state shall bring the economy under its supervision while still allowing a market economy to exist, or even prosper under our supervision, to balance relations between employers and workers, bridging their gap and forge a third way without Socialist fanaticism or unrestrained capitalism."

Despite our monarchist and Social Catholic ideals, these deranged relics have no place in our new Spain, and their so-called Catholicism is no more than a facade to justify their despotic ways. No, they shall be eliminated with the harshest methods we could muster, for there will be no peace as long as these maggots of yore still fester our nation."

sprd.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Spain"
sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. The conflict left a permanent mark on the Spanish population, the loss of what little had remained of their overseas empire. With the loss of their empire, Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest and her army was shown to be a remnant of the past. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded and the king lost what little interest he had had in governance. With the King increasingly removed from political matters and a boiling population, Spain was looking ripe for an upheaval of incredible magnitude. Military coup performed by general Primo de Rivera did little to stabilize the situation, but it did place Spain into a limbo of political stagnation. \n\n As a result of this stagnation and complacency, de Rivera was deposed after seven years of rule, and Spain would see a return to democracy the following year. After the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, even more unpopular thanks to de Rivera’s rule, accepted the will of his people and went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. Yet more, the Republicans of Izquierda Republicana and Derecha Liberal Republicana defiantly contest our right to rule. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."

### Carlist Chain ###

sprd.4.t:0 "Carlist Succession Crisis"
sprd.4.d:0 "During the hundred years of its history Carlism was headed by six successive claimants with clear heritage rights; however, in the early 1930s it was evident that the dynasty would soon extinguish. The pretender, Don Alfonso Carlos, was eighty-two years old upon assuming the claim in 1931 and had no issue. More troubling was the fact that Don Alfonso Carlos appeared to lean towards reconciliation with the Isabelline kings currently occupying the Spanish throne. After the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, King Alfonso XIII of Spain will be the senior male descendant of Carlos IV.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Carlists consider Alfonso disqualified because he does not share the Carlist ideals and because Spanish law excludes from succession the descendants of those who commit treason against the king, as Carlists deem Alfonso's male-line ancestors to have done when Francisco de Paula recognized the reign of Isabella II. Duke Javier of Bourbon-Parma is the most likely successor to Don Alfonso Carlos as he currently acts as the elderly claimant's representative in Spain. Alternatively, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg claims to be the legitimate Carlist claimant through the rights of his mother, Infanta Blanca. Both refuse to recognize the present King of Spain."
sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."

sprd.5.t:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza"
sprd.5.d:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma is considered the natural successor to the Carlist cause due to his close relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos de San Jaime. The second son of the last reigning Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Duke Javier was torn between the great powers of Europe during the Weltkrieg. Initially planning to enlist in the Austrian army to avenge his cousin Franz Ferdinand, plans changed when his adoptive France declared war on Austria-Hungary. After the Weltkrieg, Duke Javier retired to Vienna and avoided politics until the 1930s. It was in Vienna that he fostered his relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos and took an interest in Spanish legitimism, i.e. Carlism. In 1934, he moved to Spain to act as the royal octogenarian's representative. Javier is devoutly Catholic and committed to legitimism, though some far-right Traditionalists question his absolutist bona fides.\n\nSince coming to Spain, he has been a thorn in the side of King Alfonso XIII and his government. His political profile and popularity are troubling. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that the Kingdom of Spain needs to work together with its Catholic neighbours. He proposed an economic bloc with other Mediterranean nations to support each other through free trade."
sprd.5.a:0 "He is a threat. Keep him under surveillance."

sprd.6.t:0 "Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón"
sprd.6.d:0 "Born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg might seem like an odd choice for Spanish succession. Yet, through his mother, Infanta Blanca de Borbón, Karl is the grandson of Carlos VII, the last legitimate Carlist King of Spain. Unlike Duke Javier, Carlos Pío has lived in Barcelona since the 1920s. He returned to Austria briefly in the early 1930s, where he joined nationalist causes and participated in street fights with syndicalists. A significant minority of the Carlist movement believes that Carlos Pío is the natural and legitimate claimant to the throne of Spain, due to his mother's lineage and his rightist views.\n\nThe Carlist doctrine of Dual Legitimacy requires that a potential King descend legitimately from Carlos V and maintain 'legitimacy of execution' through a commitment to Spanish Traditionalism and Carlist principles. As the male line of Carlist Bourbons will be extinct when Alfonso Carlos dies without issue, descent must by necessity track through the eldest female, Infanta Blanca, and through her to her son, Carlos Pío. Carlos Pío has older brothers, but they have disqualified themselves through morganatic marriages and abdications. Carlos Pío, on the other hand, remains unmarried and has a demonstrated commitment to Traditionalism. The Archduke's supporters, known as Carloctavistas, already refer to him as Carlos VIII."
sprd.6.a:0 "A Spanish Habsburg?"

sprd.7.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón Dies"
sprd.7.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 87. He was killed in an automobile accident while crossing the street. His passing, expected at his age, but no less sudden, has thrown the Carlist factions of Spain into chaos. The current king of Spain, Alfonso XIII, is now by right the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the Carlist movement rejects any compromise with the traitorous Isabelline dynasty. They are divided between Duke Javier and Archduke Carlos, a pair of foreigners! The will of Alfonso Carlos indicates that Duke Javier should be regent of the Carlist movement until a legitimate claimant is chosen."

In this, he is aided by Manuel Fal Conde, one of Carlism’s greatest political tools, a master organizer. Groups of far-right young men gather in the north, under the guise of Catholic faith and a commitment to monarchy. His Majesty’s Guardia Civil assures him these are truthfully rebellious cells; Carlist militias preparing to challenge the throne. Don Javier uses his new publicity to question the rule of King Alfonso XIII."
sprd.8.d_carlos:0 "Following recent diplomatic successes abroad, the Carlist claimant Archduke Carlos Pío has begun touring the nation, particularly in the Basque Country and Catalonia, promoting the Carlist cause.

sprd.13.d:0 "Many left-wing parties in Spain have been a threat to our rule for years now, but few are as much of a thorn in our side as the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. Made up of the worker’s union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo and their sister party Federación Anarquista Ibérica, this movement has led numerous revolts and harassed our loyal followers. Along with the blasted Carlists, the anarchists are the main culprit behind the recent instability in Spain, and as long as they are not dealt with, we will never know peace. UNM and Renovación Española are openly calling for us the utilize Guardia Civil and perhaps even the paramilitaries of these parties to finish them. However, more moderate allies of our regime in the Accion Popular are calling for us to instead challenge them in possible upcoming elections, as the CNT-FAI rely primarily on rural peasants and may not have the numbers needed to defeat the combined might of Spain’s right through the ballot box."
sprd.13.a:0 "Ban the organisation of workers."

sprd.17.a:0 "This shows how weak they are!"

sprd.18.t:0 "CNT-FAI Takes the Stage"
sprd.18.d:0 "The CNT-FAI seem to have taken our positive governmental stance into their actions well, organising rallies and events for the many unemployed or laid off workers of Spain. While this will obviously increase their popularity and contest our rule, on the other hand it does give these men and women something to do. Idle hands, after all, are the Devil’s workshop, and while many among our supporters may consider the anarchists minions of the Devil, for the less hysterical members of Accion Popular this newfound activity has largely been a welcome one over the terror campaigns of the past."

sprd.19.t:0 "From Theory to Action"
sprd.19.d:0 "The CNT-FAI have announced that they are opening a series of public projects and mining operations along the southern coast. Organised in a communal system, these operations are loosely controlled from their headquarters in a small town called Agua Amarga. Our spies report that various anarchist theories are put into action there, but it seems to be largely agricultural and economical in nature, not militant. Officers of Guardia Civil are ordered to remain on standby, but it is perhaps best to let the anarchists play around with their theories for now."
sprd.19.a:0 "Let them work."

sprd.20.t:0 "The Results are In"
sprd.20.d:0 "The CNT-FAI's operations in the southern part of our country are steadily reaching their planned production. The organisation has put the workers to good use. Everything seems to be going very well. Obviously this will make them even more popular, but on the other hand it signals CNT-FAI’s dedication to our challenge for them, to resolve our differences in the elections and not through violence."
sprd.20.a:0 "Perhaps we can give peace a chance."


### Elections ###

sprd.21.t:0 "A Shot Rings Across Spain"
sprd.21.d:0 "Motorcade speeds through the Spanish countryside, sending dust flying high into the air. The imposing automobiles of the Guardia Real lead the way, the symbols of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy easily noticeable on the cars from far away. The few peasants working close to the road watch in silence as the king passes after the Guard’s cars, driving his beloved Hispano-Suiza personally. The times where king’s passing would’ve prompted cheers and celebration have long passed in Spain, but that does not concern the king for now. The toll of last few weeks has begun to take hold over the King, and despite the immense protests of his advisors over security concerns, Alfonso has ignored them to indulge in a rare moment of freedom..\n\n The euphoria of finally being removed from the constant politicking and backstabbing that dominates the court is overwhelming. While the king is a man of intrigue through and through, even he has his limits. As the cars rumble past an unassuming hovel, a single figure emerges from it, just as the vehicles of Guardia Real turn the corner and disappear from view. As Alfonso speeds into view, the figure raises a crude submachine gun, much to the horror of the king. As the gun fires, the king’s car veers out of the road and into the ditch nearby. The following Guardia Real car slams into the assailant and kills him immediately, his blood seeping into the thirsty earth under him. The Guards rush to help their liege, battered and unconscious, and rush him to the nearest hospital, but the situation appears grim."
sprd.21.a:0 "Mierda, Spain may truly be lost now."

sprd.22.t:0 "Alfonso is in a Coma"
sprd.22.d:0 "The king’s situation has recovered for the better, in the sense that he may no longer die in the next few hours. We have also identified the assailant as a member of the clandestine Nosaltres Sols, a Catalonian terrorist group seeking to free Catalonia from the rule of Spaniards. While the time to punish the regicide attempt must come soon, we have an even more pressing matter. The king is in a coma, and there is no sign of him waking up, and our enemies gather to utilize our precarious position. The anarchists have organised mass rallies in the countryside to pressure us into elections, the Republicans have united under Manuel Azana Diaz to demand a return to democracy and even the perfidious Carlists have made a public declaration that unless an election is held to settle Spain’s internal issues, the matter will be settled on the battlefield as is tradition for these pretenders. Accion Popular leadership has been panicking ever since the assassination attempt, but have now come to an agreement on the matter."
sprd.22.a:0 "Call for free and open elections, including any party that seeks to participate."

With final results arriving from their respective regions, the fate of Spain is revealed. Despite the incredible fracturing our society has endured over the past decades, this election may finally solve the issues once and for all. While many parties participated, only three power blocks could realistically hope to win. The CNT-FAI rallied the Spanish left, putting aside their numerous differences with the likes of BOC and PSOE for a brief period to bring about a revolution through election. The Carlists, despite their incredible disdain for elective democracy, have similarly aligned various groups of Spanish right into their movement temporarily, and now seek to dislodge the Bourbons from rule once and for all."

A significant minority with support drawn especially from the Carlist militias of the northeast, the Requetés, support the claim of Archduke Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena. Don Javier knows the Carlist revolution will not succeed without the Navarrese and Basque Requetés, but is loathe to come to an accord with Carlos Pío.

Rebel leaders are exiled to the Spanish Sahara, lest they become martyrs. The government now subsidizes the establishment of Spanish businesses on the isle, hoping to coax more peninsulares into returning to the island and giving it a loyal domestic population.

sprd.101.t:0 "The [GetYear] Spanish Elections"
sprd.101.d:0 "After the sudden end to the second Spanish republic and the formation of the royal dictatorship under Alfonso XIII and general Sarjurjo, Spain has only seen the contested "mandate" election between the Carlists, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the Accion Popular, king's puppeteers. Now that Spain has finally entered the 20th century and left behind the abhorrent relic of the past that was the previous regime, new elections have been organized to properly represent the will of the people. Dozens of parties, both regional and country-wide, will take part, though in truth only six are likely to win the elections. On the left, the reorganized PSOE socialists, united under the moderate socialist Julian Besteiro, run on a platform of heavy-handed labour reforms, redistribution of land to those that work it, and deepening of trade and diplomacy with the Third Internationale.\n\n Representing the more centrist left-wingers is Manuel Azana's Izquierda Española, moving further left thanks to an electoral alliance of various small socialist movements and regional parties. They represent the middle class but with sympathies to the workers too, and seek to bring about a just, equal Spain, where education and institutions are removed from church influence. To their right, representing left-leaning liberals, is Union Española led by Diego Martinez Barrio. While unlike to win, due to the influence of Azaña's party, the growing resentment towards Alejandro Lerroux's radicals could lead to their supporters turning towards the more traditionalist left-wing Radicals under Martinez Barrio.\n\nThe centre-rights are dominated by the two giants of the original republican movement, which have nonetheless taken very different routes. Known for their moderate stance on most matters, despite the name, the Radicals have sought to repair their reputation following the collapse of the authoritarian regime. Known for collaborating with the monarchists and even the Catholics despite their previous anti-clerical attitudes, Lerroux is not expected to win unless his party pulls of a miracle and manages to reinvent its image. This is not helped by the fact that the president of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, and his Derecha Liberal party is increasingly popular after its leader returned from exile in Uruguay. Their party runs on a platform of liberal conservatism, secularism and respect for the regional minorities of Spain.\n\n Finally, the Accion Popular represents the most right-wing party, seeking to capitalize on the open defiance to Catholic church most other parties, supporting more traditional and even at times authoritarian currents in the Spanish society. Advocating for a society built on so called social Catholicism, large role of the king and church in society, extensive centralization of Spain especially in regards to the many minorities and resistance to socialists and republicans. Many view the party with suspicions give its role in the royal dictatorship, but its new leader José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones has agreed to respect the new monarch's wishes for democracy, though how credible these claims are remains to be seen."

Many of our centralist parties, such as Accion Popular, see the existence of autonomous regions as a breeding ground for separatism, and many even in our government tend to agree with this sentiment. After all, the would-be assailant of Alfonso XIII was Catalan radical separatist\n\n Others, more moderate parties such as Derecha Liberal Republicana, PSOE and Izquierda Republicana have advised agreed to support the creation of so called Autonomous Communes, which would finally acknowledge the various cultures, languages and peoples as equals. This increased autonomy, it is hoped, would then create newfound pride and satisfaction in our Kingdom."

Regardless, Spain is more united than it has ever been, and although there are still pockets of dissent in a few regions such as Basque country and Catalonia, these movements are much smaller than they have ever been even before the war."

However, there has been some pushback to this idea, particularly among French nationalists and monarchists who resent the plan of a foreigner on ‘their’ throne.

sprd.111.d:0 "Few expected CNT-FAI, one of the most important actors in Spain's political scene, to simply fall apart, but that appears to be the case. After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union.\n\nÁngel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility. He stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocater for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists.\n\nWhile  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

sprd.112.d:0 "After the election victory of Accion Popular showed Spaniards that the right-wing monarchists could still hold their grounds against the former republicans despite the democratization of the Kingdom, new movements have begun developing to contest Accion Popular's grip on their voter base. One such movement, and the most likely to dislodge the former from their seat as primary monarchist party, is Partido Nacionalista Español. Returning from the brink of irrelevancy, it's fiery denouncement of republican and socialist values has brought it many supporters. Backed by the Catholic church and agrarian peasants from the more conservative regions of Spain, the party seeks to eradicate regionalism by centralizing the Kingdom, defeat the socialist parties by utilizing its supporters in the Sindicatos Libres to harass them, and finish off any republican sentiments by allying with like-minded centre- and extreme-right parties to form a cohesive bloc against anything that would threaten the traditional Spain.\n\nWhile not publicly endorsed by the king, its leader José María Albiñana has announced that he wishes to expand the king's powers closer to their original scope, although the party leader has somewhat tried to moderate this rhetoric to not lose any credibility inside the democratic system. The party views corporatism, social Catholicism and uniting monarch as the cornerstones of its program, and while not anti-democratic per se, many view it with suspicion of harbouring dangerous authoritarian viewpoints. Whether the party will be a death knell to Spain's young democracy or not will be seen, though first this party must pass the hurdle of defeating its rivals in the elections."

sprd.113.d:0 "Madrid is ablaze from socialist riots, its factories empty and its streets a battlefield between Guardia Civil and the militants of PSOE party and UGT unionists. In the rural areas, as well as whole regions such as Asturias, small-scale revolts from the likes of CNT and FAI are happening constantly, the anarchists attacking estates and police stations in a hit-and-run fashion. The king and his allies in Accion Popular and the military have deployed military forces to quell the riots, but these units are used sparingly, as to avoid the conscripts from joining forces with the rioters. The perfidious republicans are arranging protests even in areas where radical riots are not a problem. And in the overseas territories, especially Moroccan coastal areas, the devious Moroccans have sent agitators and saboteurs over the border, driving the locals to a frenzy. The military is unable to deploy the loyalist Spanish legion in the metropolitan areas because of the fear of Moroccan revolt. However, despite the dire straits Spain is in right now, it seems that the emergency measures taken after the election by the monarchists have paid off, as the socialists and republicans are split between the insurrectionists and those who honour the democratic mandate of Accion Popular.\n\n However, in the chaos the central government did not realize the lack of news from the minority regions of Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia. In a surprise declaration, the three regions denounced the centralist policies of the monarchy and its military allies, and claimed that Spain has fallen back to its reactionary abyss, stomping on the rights of its peoples just to enrich Castile. Despite all the promises, autonomy to the minority peoples of Spain was never delivered in full. Now, the Basques, Catalans and Galicians would join each other in solidarity and officially separate from the dying empire of Castile and its chauvinistic domination of sovereign peoples. The three separatists called for other peoples’ of Spain to seize the moment as well, and free themselves from the Bourbon tyrants once and for all. The central government, overstretched as it was with internal strife, could not respond to this new threat, and the local Guardia Civil units retreated from the regionalist areas, for the time being."

Their frenzied attacks whittled down the morale of even the bravest Spanish soldiers, and now, general Mola has ordered a full scale retreat, as our supply routes are pillaged by anarchist guerillas.

Now, however, it seemed that their parties had managed to find some semblance of unity, and this unity brought them resolve to resist our attacks one after another. In the winding mountain paths leading further into Galicia, snipers and militia irregular ambushed us before retreating further in, stretching the nerves and resolve of our men to the snapping point. General Vega was forced to call for a full retreat after a devastating battle at the Samos Monastery, where Galician militias managed to delay our forces long enough for their reinforcements to pin us down and crush most of the local division. The politicians of Accion Popular have called for the king to crush the pitiful insurgents, but seeing the state of Spain, the king has agreed with the military’s policy of admitting defeat."

The king, seeing the writing on the wall, followed in his father’s footsteps, and has boarded a plane headed for Portugal earlier this morning. With the country spiraling out of control, a group of generals have stepped in once more to stop this chaos from leading to total eradication of Spain. Led by the populist general Sarjurjo, the new regime has denounced all enemies of Spain, from anarchists, socialists and republicans all the way to the separatists. The new junta, however, is not exactly united in vision, and the bickering of the generals has made any proper counter-attack against the separatists possible.\n\n Realizing this, general Sarjurjo has gathered the generals for a meeting in the military headquarters of Madrid, seeking to settle the leadership question of the new Spain once and for all. This decision is hardly surprising, as Sarjurjo has immense amount of political clout due to the success of his Sarjurjada, the revolt that ended the republican regime in 1932. However, his rule is far from absolute, as many in Spain and among the military blame him for all the mistakes of the last few years. Contesting his rule are a selection of generals, all with their own visions for Spain. Perhaps the most peculiar character is the leader of the Spanish Legion, José Millan-Astray, who is known as an eccentric fanatic, with some claiming him to be borderline insane due to drug use and war injuries. His polar opposite is Emilio Mola, who is known for his calculating nature and usage of extreme means while working as a chief security official of the Spanish republic and later, kingdom. Camilo Alonso Vega, Juan Yague and Francisco Franco Bahamonde represent more traditional junta members, following many of the tenets established in the Primo de Rivera era, though Alonso Vega and Juan Yague are willing to go further on many issues than Franco. Yague is also known for his sympathies towards Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a far-right party espousing Hispanist ideology.  Finally, the junta could simply install the son of Primo de Rivera, José Antonio, as the leader. While not a military man, the young Primo de Rivera has been remarkably active in politics of Accion Popular and enjoys a great deal of influence among the far-right of Spain.

While the party still chafes under the restrictions placed upon it by the democratic system, some members of AP have begun to embrace it fully. The party still retains some of its authoritarian characteristics, willing to use force against the syndicalist infiltrators of CNT-FAI and Carlist devils, but the infamous Greenshirts of AP have very much been leashed from their youthful rage against the would-be oppressors of Spain’s faithful and noble people. The party now leans more towards typical Christian democrats, just with a few more aces up its sleeve and a considerably bolstered radical wing. The king himself has praised this development, claiming that without Accion Popular’s commitment to democracy, the new crown could not have legitimized its rule as easily, and by creating a more moderate version of themselves, Accion Popular has managed to convince many of even Spain’s royal house being able to adjust for the times as well."

sprd.122.d:0 "The 19th century was very difficult for Spain in general, but few events of that turbulous era left such a mark on Spanish public consciousness as the Spanish-American war of the mid-1890s. The loss of our last overseas colonial holdings in America and Asia, namely the islands of Cuba and Philippines, sent Spanish public into a deep crisis. Our society had been based on imperial glory, colonial pride and the Restoration era circulation of parties, known as el turno pacífico, where the Spanish Liberal and Conservative parties alternated in the government. When the colonies were lost, the entire Spanish economy and cultural basis pulled the plug on this alternating system and revealed the many flaws in it, which in turn lead to academic opposition and protests. These academics would be the very beginnings of Generation ‘98, and while this movement started as a simple protest, it soon evolved into complete regeneration of Spain’s culture, ranging from literature to music. The movement spawned such titans of Spanish culture as Miguel de Unamuno, Pio Baroja and Joaquin Costa.\n\n The generation was highly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who was best known for his arguments for academics to be free of dogmatic thinking, and to some extent, his ideas on divinity more as an universal essence rather than as a personalist mythical figure. The influence of Krausism also helped shape the movement towards more egoist direction. The generation demanded change in Spain’s political scene, and that itself created an atmosphere of acceptance towards radicalism, aimed at changing the stalled political scene and the impotent reforms brought about by el turno pacífico. Like most generations in Spain’s history, Generation of ‘98 was not particularly ideologically aligned, instead inspiring actors from left-wing revolutionaries all the way to the right-wing traditionalists, all calling for Spain to regenerate and rejuvenate itself, though the means to achieve this differed greatly from actor to another. Accion Popular, also greatly inspired by this movement and two of its most prolific writers, Ramiro de Maeztu and Joaquin Costa, has started a program aimed at promoting the ideas and works of the generation, with of course the left-wing ideologues excluded from the program. The leadership of the party hopes that this increased attention will bring about a more patriotic Spanish youth eventually."

sprd.123.d:0 "Despite our successful electoral results and a rather tremendous reimagination of Accion Popular, the party still remains as a big-tent for various monarchists, both reactionary and liberal, as well as agrarians, Christian democrats and even fringe legionaries. These factions have generally agreed upon a policy of Christian conservatism and moderate monarchism, but as time passes, the factionalism is starting to tear us apart. Leadership of the party, as well as the king, finds this situation untenable. The king has urged us to pick a direction before we face oblivion at the hands of our more ideologically rigid rivals. This decision, however, is bound to be a hard one. We can obviously fully dedicate our party program to Christian democracy, placating the moderates and centre of our party, but losing support from the more radical factions. There are however other, less conventional choices proposed by other party members.\n\n Our prime minister, José María Gil-Robles, has long been an admirer of Austrian right-wing demagogue, Engelbert Dolfuss, and the Austropopulist ideology he champions in the heartland of Catholicism. This choice would be a radical one, as Austropopulism has hardly been tried in a democratic system and its critics consider it wholly incompatible. However, the corporatist, nationalist and fiercely Catholic nature does draw some of the most firebrand monarchists within our party towards this conclusion.\n\n Others, less extreme members of AP seek to steer the movement towards more traditional conservatism, following the Maurist ideology of strong state intervention, moderate Spanish nationalism, social Catholicism and the integration of some liberal ideals into the Spanish right. While less radical than Austropopulism, Maurism is also somewhat marred by the many directions the movement has been pulled towards by various politicians, such as Antonio Goicoechea and Jose Calvo Sotelo. However, Maurism under Gabriel Maura, Antonio’s son, is considered the current mainstream form, and is likely to be the most palatable to democratic Spain."

Standing firm under the King, serving his every command, we have united Spanish people under the core values of corporatism, faith, kingdom and national pride. While Spain is yet to reclaim the glory days of the empire, we have thwarted its descent into chaos and ruin, and from here, we can only take it to greater heights! Spain is back as a global power, and like the armadas of the past, our reach will only grow from here, destroying socialists and agents of false gods as we march onwards. While we may not hold the absolute power we did years ago, Accion Popular has shown itself adaptive enough to fit into the defines of democracy, although very much in our own way.

But the coup of 1932 saved Spain from this terrible fate, and for four years, General Jose Sarjurjo allowed us to rule Spain and shape it in our image. While that period was mired by conflicts within Accion Popular, instability caused by terrorists, both the blasted separatists and the demonic anarchists, and the weak position of our king and government due to military interference, it was also the height of our power thus far. Yet with two electoral victories under our belt in a very short span of time, first against our arch-nemesi, the Carlists and anarchists, and then against the republicans, we have shown thoroughly that the Spanish people trust our rule above all else. \n\nWith this newfound mandate, and the weakened grip of the military on Spanish affairs, we can finally set upon fulfilling the wishes of AP leadership. Spain shall be united and freed from the insidious influence of syndicalists and Carlists alike, and the corrupting influence of republicanism will be cremated once and for all. The various regional parties that constitute the Accion Popular have rallied under the banner of Spanish monarchist right, and we have even been bolstered by defectors from the Carlist cause, so AP is finally strong enough to contest even the strongest ex-republican party in congress. While we are going to be more limited than before due to the democratic system, it is a compromise we have been forced to take. The path that lies ahead will not be an easy one, but with our king and Jefe leading us, we shall push Accion Popular to newfound heights!"

sprd.126.t:0 "Allies of Convenience"
sprd.126.d:0 "As the new constitutional monarchy solidifies in Spain, the parties themselves are equally shifting in their policies to fit this new system. One of the most curious cases to observe has been the rebranded Partido Radical led by Alejandro Lerroux, which in the past was a thorn in the kingdom’s side due to its incredibly strong anti-clericalism and negative stance on the monarchy. Lerroux himself was implied to be part of many assassination attempts on king Alfonso even though nothing was ever confirmed. While his party would appear to be our staunchest enemy, this does not need to be the case. Lerroux is known to be a man of many vices, and his party is known for one thing above all else: corruption. In the last years, the radicalism of Partido Radical has vaned immensely, the party becoming little more than a political machine for Lerroux and his clique to chase more wealth and power. As such, while we share little with the Lerrouxists ideologically, allying them would not be particularly difficult.\n\n Accion Popular could promise to invest in the infrastructure of Lerroux’s seat of power, the boulevard of Paraleo in Barcelona, alongside a promise to turn a blind eye to the man’s ‘business’ ventures that certain law enforcement agencies in Spain would otherwise be quite interested in. In exchange, Lerroux would join us in coalition, and as his support base consists of the Spanish workers of Barcelona, we could use their helps to battle the great evils of Catalonia, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the separatists of Nosaltres Sols. However, while Lerroux is more of an ally of convenience, there are other groups that align with us ideologically but lack the widespread support of AP. An influential but small party, Partido Agrario shares our rural-minded, Catholic and monarchist sentiments, but has always struggled to gather the popular support that we have. While more moderate than AP, Partido Agrario has been an electoral ally of the Carlists in the past and thus allying with them would starve our rivals of an ally."

But to us loyal and fervent Catholics, no side in that conflict is as important as that of the Papal States, the most holy city serving as the seat of power for the representative of Christ on Earth, the Pope. When Italy fell to war and division, in a rare case of unity both Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists decided to fight side by side to stop the Reds from claiming the city, and the volunteers from that conflicts helped shape Papal-Spanish relations for decades to come. However, given the hard times Spain fell to in the last years, it has been hard to keep these relations as close as we would have liked. Now, however, as Accion Popular has solidified itself as the popular ruler of Spain, we must immediately dispatch an envoy to the Vatican and pledge our undying support to the righteous cause of God. Whichever side the Pope supports in the upcoming unification wars will be our ally as well, and together we shall destroy the godless syndicalists of the north. Italy will be united, and the seat of God’s power protected once more by pious sons of Italy, assisted by the Spaniards at every turn should they require the assistance.

sprd.128.d:0 "Since the coronation of Isabella II as the queen of Spain, our nation has been plagued by a pestilence known as Carlism. Clinging to an age-old dynastic feud, the Carlists have plunged Spain into numerous civil wars, coming out of their Navarran mountains to harass the good people of Spain. The untold damage they have done to our nation with their delusions and unjustified violence has taken blood, sweat and toil to repair, yet still their presence lingers in Spain’s northern territories, their fanatical followers, Requetes, striking our noble Carabineros like some sort of spectres of ruination. Their corrupting influence has been too hard to root out in the last few difficult decades, but similarly their relevance has been weakened. Only in the last few years during and after the republic did the movement gather enough steam to seriously contest the rightful king’s rule, and when the Carlists unsurprisingly were defeated in the elections, their movement fell apart. The hardliner Cruzadistas supporting Carlos Pio as king blamed the supporters of Javier Bourbon-Parma for the humiliating defeat, claiming that their softness prevented the Carlists from seizing the initiative and defeating the Alfonsine monarchy. The Intergristas, ideologically similar to the Frenchman Charles Maurras but far less concrete in their beliefs, simply either gave up or jumped ship to join Renovacion Espanola. This Carlist defeatism may have been rectified had they managed to unite under one candidate, but as Javier escaped to Algiers and Carlos returned to Austria, the movement began to fizzle out into oblivion. While hardliners still remain especially in Navarre and Basque Country, their numbers are not large enough to contest our rule, and some officers have demanded that the army boots finally stomp this pathetic pretender regime out. Others, such as colonel Valera and general Emilio Mola, current military commissioner of Pamplona, have urged for caution, arguing that the Carlists will run out of steam on their own. Ultimately, the decision lies on the king, as the officer corps is notoriously badly infiltrated by traditionalists, with even general Sarjurjo, the hero of the Alfonsine monarchy, being accused of harbouring Carlist sympathies. Without their leadership, it may be that the Carlists cannot unify en masse, but on the other hand further violence may cause political instability and prolong the existence of the Carlists if the operation fails."

JAP has grown to be one of the most powerful youth organizations in Spain, boasting close to 15 000 members, but its involvement with the regime has been far from easy. JAP continues to be a hotbed of radicalism within Accion Popular, and while in the past, during the years of AP’s sole governance, this was seen as ‘youthful desire to regenerate Spain’ and ‘ideological innovation for future monarchists’, this radicalism has become an awkward issue for the party. As Accion Popular has pretty much been strong-armed into the mold of a democratic party, the rascals of JAP are constantly causing us scandals and crises with their clashes with liberals and socialists. The movement’s current head, José María Valiente Soriano, is a known traditionalist, and has even been accused of secretly harbouring Carlist sympathies in the past. His traditionalism has particularly hampered the moderation of JAP, as he turns a blind eye to any bloodshed of former republicans, and some within AP believe that he is coordinating attacks to further his own agenda. However, due to his tenure as the movement’s leader and strong connections to the original leadership of AP, it would be costly to remove him. But should we choose to do so, a likely successor in the form José María Pérez de Laborda has already been chosen by AP’s leadership.

sprd.130.d:0 "As PNE's stewardship of Spain continues, the party has begun to see itself transform to fit its new role. While originally a big tent party of various right-wing ideologues, drawing its support from rural agrarian peasants, anti-syndicalist militants and radical  Catholic clergymen, the party now spends about as much time balancing these interests as it does forming policies and creating laws. The prime minister Albiñana finds this situation untenable, as it stretches the party thin and causes internal conflicts that are easily exploited by its main rivals, socialists of PSOE and the liberals of Izquierda Española and Union Española. A small-scale congress has been called among party elites to finally settle the ideological differences and create an unified structure. After all, a party calling for Spain to unite as whole is laughable if it cannot unify itself first. As the congress begins, several blocs form within it. Among the most influential is the Legionaries of Albiñana, who propose following the Romanian and Italian Legionary model but form-fitting it to the conditions of Spain. This would see the movement pay lip service to democracy while pursuing its policies of heavy nationalism, militarization and political repression of undesirable influences on Spanish "nature".\n\n They are opposed by the Christian democratic wing, which calls for the movement to adopt policies championed by various Spanish Catholic parties, but with an even firmer grip and vision than those parties usually contain. Highly monarchist and pro-clergy, it would see the movement transition into a more traditionalist position, and likely cause the integration of various smaller Christian democrat parties, such as Partido Agrario, into our movement.\n\n However, there is one more faction within PNE that champions the adoption of a very specific brand of Catholic nationalism, the Mexican Synarchism, which would likely see our movement take a rather autocratic turn. While it would likely not be impossible to utilize this form of ideology inside a democratic system, something PNE must at least attempt to adhere to, it would mean large compromises to function. Lastly, something Albiñana himself supports, is the ideological drift towards Hispanism, something he himself became familiar with during his time in Mexico. While that particular idea is mostly a Latin American one, Albiñana argues that ideas from that movement could be applied to the Spanish setting just as well. Doing so would likely increase Spain's interest in the former colonies, although what shape this interest would take remains to be seen. It would also likely strengthen the anti-regionalist wing of PNE. The congress discussed these issues at length, but ultimately one side emerges victorious."

The new government may have expected a warm welcome given PNE's overt monarchism, but the king and his advisers raised their demands almost immediately after a short congratulatory note. PNE's history with paramilitary action and terror tactics against political opponents were denounced by the king. He proclaimed that now the party had entered into mainstream politics and was responsible for Spain's governance, it would have to moderate its rhetoric and means to achieve political goals. According to the king and his advisors, they would not allow for such barbaric street clashes and polarization as Alfonso XIII had done, for Spain had nearly been destroyed twice by it.\n\n For the good of the monarchy and Spain itself, the party would have to seek a compromise between its firebrand agenda and the democratic system, or else it would lose credibility in the eyes of the king and his people. Albiñana was quick to assure the king that while PNE was committed to its program, it would make necessary adjustments needed for stability of the realm. The Legionaries of Albiñana would return to their original purpose as the party leader's personal bodyguards. Similarly, Albiñana's initial plan was to focus on its less controversial policies first, such as implementation of the corporatist system, agrarian reforms, education reform to expand access of middle and lower class students to higher education and the strengthening of church status. The king seemed to agree with these notions for now, though Albiñana was certain that the King's secret service would keep an eye open for their activities. Still, if moderation was temporarily needed for PNE's transformation of Spain, then it would have to do for the time being."

While we can only hope that these lost souls find their way to the light one day, there are other parties more aligned with our ideology that could be integrated into PNE. Probably the most important would be Partido Agrario, a small party in the large-scale Spanish politics but still highly important, especially in local level. They have also historically been willing to ally with the Carlists, especially during the republican era, so absorbing them into our organization would starve the wounded Carlists of one more ally.\n\n Of lesser significance are the Derecha Regional Agraria and Peña Blanca, first being a group of agrarians and Christian democrats representing the national part of the regional party, Derecha Regional Valenciana and the second being a group of wealthy landowners and traditionalist monarchists. While these two parties are not massive by any means, the populist approach of DRA and the wealth of PB’s members would serve our cause well. However, some of the members of Pena Blanca are known to be associated with the extremely radical monarchist faction, Renovacion Espanola, and associating with them could bring the ire of the more moderate republicans on us. Similarly, DRA is in turn possibly too moderate for our party, causing us to slip closer to the compromising Christian democrats. Though some within our party have also argued that should we integrate DRA, it could serve as a facade to our commitment to democracy, allowing our more militant wing to continue their actions against the insidious forces seeking to corrupt the Spanish spirit."

sprd.133.t:0 "Theory of Hispanidad"
sprd.133.d:0 "As PNE grows into the role of the steward of Spain’s right-wing movements, we have attracted many prominent right-wing thinkers from other parties, such as Eduardo Callejo de la Cuesta and Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, as well as the monarchist generals Antonio Aranda and Luis Orgaz Yoldi, joining us mostly from the monarchist parties Union Monarquica Nacional and Accion Espanola. However, probably the largest influence to our movement has been Ramiro de Maeztu, known theorist of Hispanidad, a set of central characteristics of the Hispanic race. While de Maeztu has been forced to tone down his rabid anti-democratic rhetoric upon joining the party, due to PNE’s attempt to hold at least a facade of adhering to democracy, his ideas of Hispanidad have been instrumental in the party’s direction ever since the theorist joined us.\n\n The main tenets of his beliefs are outlined in the book released in 1934, Defensa de la hispanidad, where he argues that Spanish, and in more general terms, Hispanic peoples, must return to ‘pure Spanishness’. In de Maeztu’s words this means a spiritual connection between Spain and its former colonies, not guided by the false gods of liberalism and rationalism but the indomitable Spanish spirit, bolstered by his own take on the French revolutionary slogan ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ being replaced with ‘duty, hierarchy, and humanity’. The Catholic faith and mission is also very heavily visible in his theories, seeing Catholic teachings of hierarchy, charity and humble servitude as a counterpoint to the isolating and selfish ideals of the Western individualist liberalism. His critics have in turn attacked him for being only half-Spanish himself, as his mother was British, and yet more have considered de Maeztu’s inclusion into PNE problematic due to his sister, Maria de Maeztu’s activities with feminism and liberalism. Still, his theories are far too important to our movement to pass up, and as de Maeztu approached Prime Minister Albinana directly, it was impossible for the latter to decline the offer of such a prolific right-wing ideologue."

sprd.134.d:0 "Unión Patriótica, the party created in support of general Miguel Primo de Rivera’s regime and soon absorbed to be the sole party of the dictatorship, has long been an inspiration to the Spanish right. Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn, even if minor concessions must be made towards the whining voices of former republicans, who still cling to democracy as if it could save Spain.\n\n Under the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albinana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albinana’s Legionaries.\n\n While majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albinana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

sprd.135.d:0 "Prime Minister Albinana has, above all else, stressed the importance of Spanish spirit. To have been born as a Spaniard is the greatest honour one can have, and true Hispanism must be protected from those that would seek to shatter the unity. PNE has always stood at the forefront of neo-traditionalism, leaving behind the shackles of past that the Carlist cling onto, while revering Spain’s sacred institutions and traditions to the greatest extent. After all, few nations can claim such a glorious legacy as the mighty Espana. And yet, despite all this, despite all the glories our nation has created and achieved, even in our beloved Iberia the separatist rot gnaws at Hispanic unity and purity. The Basques, supposedly an ancient race yet to our eyes, just a relic of the past, still retain their outdated language and customs. At the very least they have seen the good graces of God and follow Catholicism almost as fervently as any loyal sons of Spain.\n\n But whereas Basques have some redeeming qualities, in the land of the Catalans, there is little of such notions to be found. These fools claim that they have a right to a Catalan nationhood, yet have never existed as an independent nation, only ever as a part of Spain and its numerous smaller kingdoms. Their most radical members even hatched the sinister plot to murder beloved king Alfonso XIII and almost succeeded, going mostly unpunished until now. This, simply cannot stand. The Basque and Catalan nationalists will be destroyed or assimilated, their leaders imprisoned or driven to exile. Already, Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops are being directed to these areas to drive the separatists out, and they will be assisted by our excellent Legionaries as well as the newly established Somatén of Catalonia. Their rot will never again spoil a single harvest of Spain’s finest, and not a single loyal son of Spain will be lead to separatist delusions. Spain will know unity, for otherwise we are lost in this mad world."

sprd.136.d:0 "Without the Legionaries of Spain, or Legionaries of Albinana as they have become to be known, PNE would likely not exist. In truth, the reformation of the movement from street thugs fighting strikers and socialist agitators into the only traditionalist democratic party in Spain has not been an easy one, as the Legionaries constantly feel sidelined by the politicians and civilians. This isn’t helped by Albinana’s calls for moderation within their ranks. The Legionaries were originally described as Albinana to be ‘citizen volunteers with direct, fulminating and expeditious intervention in any act that threatens or depresses the prestige of the country’, so it is not surprising that as their actions are more moderated and constrained, the men are getting restless.\n\n In order to stop these young, active and energetic men from jumping ship to some other radical movements, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, we must find them some enemies to fight, especially given our precarious position in the public eye. In the past, the Legionaries caused many victories for the traditionalist cause, defeating Catalan nationalists, socialists and liberals alike, but as many of these forces have now become our parliamentary rivals, attacking them in such a brash manner would sour our image in the public eye.\n\n As we have to play by the soft playbook of parliamentary politics, at last for now, the targets for Legionaries must instead be those of the radicals. We could break relations with the Carlists, who we have so far been quite close to, and gain support from the liberals and Alfonsine monarchists, but this would cause us to lose a political ally otherwise. Similarly, we can focus on the radical socialists and anarchists of CNT-FAI, and crush these insolent terrorists once and for all. Final option is to divert the Legionaries to combat Catalans, Basques and Galicians who seek to gain their independence from Spain, but this would mean leading the men away from the heartland of Spain and make them temporarily unavailable to use against other political opponents."

Hysterical liberals and socialists rioted and wrote such wild statements, claiming that PNE would bring about the second reactionary dictatorship. Yet through careful maneuvering, clever political alliances and an ever-shifting perspective on governance, we have lead Spain into a new age, where its loyal men no longer need to bow their heads and consider themselves inferior to other Europeans. We alone have uplifted Spain from its stupor, raising it on its own two knees, where the Spanish folk could finally realize their inner potential and the superiority of the Hispanic spirit. The values of nation, religion and monarchy are now instilled in every institute of Spain, leading the nation according to traditional values when need be, while adopting some new innovations that will only make us stronger in the end. Never have we been so well-protected than under the ever vigilant watch of the Legionaries, who stand to thwart any plot by the separatists or socialists.

This influenced him politically, and especially deepened his fascination with Hispanism both academically and politically. But while he was hardly politically active in the region during his time there, working mainly as a doctor, Albinana nonetheless was targeted by Mexico’s fearsome leader, Plutarco Calles, a feud that eventually lead to Albinana leaving the country and the New World entirely. After returning to Spain, our leader became politically involved and devoted much of his time to that, but the old feud resurfaced in his mind from time to time. Now that news have reached Spain about Plutarco Calles’ takeover, Albinana cannot shake the feeling of the idea gnawing at his mind, and as he has confided to his aides about it, some have suggested that we prepare an expedition to rid Mexico of the tyrant once and for all. While the logistics of such an endeavor are questionable, it would help ease our leader’s mind and as a bonus, we would be liberating our Hispanic brothers from socialist influence."

The monarchy, especially under Alfonso XIII, had not been a friend of syndicalists or democrats in general, and the Spanish anarchists despised them all the same. However, after a loaded exchange of platitudes and empty compliments, the king decided to cut to the chase and commented that while he was not a fan of the syndicalists, the monarchy had decided to stand behind the democratic system and as long as Partido Sindicalista would respect it as well, they would work together. Pestaña and his ministers approved these terms, and the two, ideologically almost diametrically opposed actors, begun drafting ways for the cooperation to work.\n\n One of the major talking points was the foreign policy of the new Spain, and the king's council made it clear that any attempts to join the Third Internationale would lead to a complete destruction of this ceasefire between PS and monarchy, causing the mobilization of all Spanish reactionaries against this threat. The members of Partido Sindicalista approved this request as well, an easy decision given the members of Third Internationale already saw them as traitors given their more liberal current of syndicalism. The negotiations between syndicalists and monarchist continued long into the night, but eventually all the finer details of this new agreement were honed out. While the co-existence of the monarch and his syndicalists would be an awkward one, it was nonetheless yet another step towards a stronger, less divided Spain."

sprd.142.d:0 "Spain and Portugal have had a very diverse history, with periods of rivalry and cooperation ebbing and flowing depending on the rulers and global politics. However, dreams of an united Iberia, one where the division of two nations would be washed away and their cultures unified under one banner, are nothing new. Closest example of these dreams was during the First Spanish Republic, when the idea of a federal Spain gave way to even more grandiose ideas of Iberian federation. These never came to fruition, and this sense of an unified peninsula were forgotten in part after the wave of Hispanism that rose to the forefront after the loss of Cuba and Philippines in 1898. But while Spanish reactionaries and imperialists desperately hanged on to misplaced imperial legacy, among the ranks of the anarchist FAI and its youth division, Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias, Iberism gained some ground, even leading to talks with their Portuguese comrades, though the lack of enthusiasm from Portugal did put a damper on the spread of Iberism there.\n\n Now, however, with Partido Sindicalista guiding Spain, some within our movement have resurrected the idea of an united Iberia, even though the form this would take differs greatly from the ideas of FAI. While this idealism was originally not considered worth pursuing, given the hesitancy of PS’ leadership to participate in wars, the tyrannical rule of the Portuguese monarchy and increasing shift towards totalitarianism has made many question whether we can allow such an affront to all democratic values to occupy the peninsula. The king has offered his support should PS pursue Iberism and prepare for a conflict with Portugal, though whether we fully embrace the idea and unite Iberia or simply topple the reactionary monarchy of Portugal is up to Pestana."

While Partido Sindicalista is essentially a very moderated version of CNT-FAI’s programs, anti-clericalism is still incredibly strong inside our party. While the new constitution helped weaken the grip of the church on the matters of state, Pestana and other politicians of the party have called for increased process towards total secularization of Spain. Now that PS achieved dominance over Spanish politics, this vision of a Spain set free of the greatest gatekeeper towards true liberation is set in motion.\n\nEducation will be entirely removed from the grasp of the church, large portions of church wealth will be confiscated and directed towards actual charity and not the robbery disguised as ‘support for the faithful’ the church pushes, and the Jesuit order, the vipers rotting the Spanish foundation with their poison, will be expelled. CNT-FAI rebelled against the church and burned their properties, becoming a favourite scapegoat for the authorities. Now that we have actual legal means for dealing with the church, we can right the wrongs they’ve pushed upon the Spanish people for centuries, the crimes of the Inquisition and the corruption of the clergy finally avenged. While we cannot completely dismantle this antique institution as it would simply invite conservative revolution , we can limit its power to a size where it will never again dominate Spain.

However, there are those who still decry the outdated attitudes of CNT and FAI, especially among the women who would otherwise support these movements. When Spain was reaching boiling point in 1936, a group of CNT-FAI supporters, namely Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada, and Amparo Poch y Gascón, formed Mujeres Libres, an organization meant to pursue what they considered the second goal of anarchist revolution in Spain.\n\n These women think that as the anarchist revolution brings forth a society without state control and capitalist oppression, it should also liberate women from antiquated gender roles and paternalistic attitudes of men. While this liberation has often been mentioned in anarchist literature and theories, actual commitment to it in the ranks of CNT-FAI and its FIJL youth wing has been dubious. As such, Mujeres Libres drives the vanguard of anarchist liberation of women, and given the passivity of CNT-FAI, we could possibly gain the votes of Mujeres Libres if we fully committed to the cause of gender equality. Some have even suggested contacting the Mujeres Libres leadership and offering full integration into Partido Sindicalista, as equal partners."

Our nation is so incredibly outdated both in cultural, economical and educational terms that many of our former colonies in the New World will soon overtake us in some regards. Illiteracy has yet to be stomped out, with twenty-five percent of Spaniards still lacking the ability to read and more yet not knowing how to write. With women, this is even worse, with the average women’s literacy being roughly sixty percent country-wide and dipping into sub-thirty percent in regions such as the Basque country. As we seek to destroy the Church control on education, new alternatives for schools and literary programs must be looked into.\n\n Partido Sindicalista’s background as a former members of the CNT-FAI have given them some ideas as to how this is to be done, as CNT-FAI has for quite some time organized grassroots classes and clubs for the workers to learn new skills, most importantly reading and writing. If we were to adopt this model and give it actual funding but no further state control, it could lead to an actual difference in literacy levels. These organizations could then further promote decentralization of the state and creation of local level communities for other causes as well, such as laying the groundwork for unions, co-operatives and other forms of worker self-organization."

Today, after all our programs have been launched, it is clear that Partido Sindicalista has proven the fearmongers wrong. While they may not agree with our policies, we have remained faithful to the new democratic values of Spain, and the restraint with which Pestana and other members of the party have shown during these last months has even caused worldwide discussion of how Possibilism can walk the tightrope of anarcho-syndicalist ideals, liberal democratic realities and most importantly, the utter paradox of a syndicalist Spain lorded over by a monarch.\n\n Over the border, the French communards see us as little more than traitors to the cause, but we can stand proud in the fact that we have, truly, made this paradox work, and through our actions, Spain has entered a new era of true freedom, equality and progress."

To be frank, Pestaña never expected this victory, as while many among the now largely defunct CNT-FAI joined his party, they were still in many ways smaller than even some of the centrist parties. However, PS's  last few rallies gathered enough support to propel the newcomer party to victory, but now it must face a difficult dilemma. Many within PS demand significant changes in Spain, but pushing too hard for reforms at such an early level could cause Spain to collapse into a civil war, something that was so narrowly avoided not long ago. As such, while many radicals within PS call for a complete social revolution and toppling of the monarchy, Pestaña and the party leadership have focused their efforts instead on making economic reforms with the help of syndicalist unions, utilizing the literary clubs of CNT-FAI to spread education among workers and completely rehauling the rural and naval industries, where PS's main support base is working in.\n\nNew coalition has been formed with PSOE, Izquierda Española and Union Española, which will help the small majority PS has immensely.Already, alliances with the anti-clerical parties are being struck to hammer in new legislation, further curtailing church grip on the rural population. Criminal justice is being rehauled to be more democratic, and party envoys have been sent to Izquierda Española and PSOE to further coordinate labour law developments, and while the party must make massive compromises when it comes to combating capitalists, PS is however proposing massive changes among both rural and urban workers. It remains to be seen if the new party can push its heavily syndicalist program against its caqiquismo and clerical enemies, but so far moral in the party remains high."

After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union. Ángel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility.\n\nHe stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocate for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists. While  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

It is this disunity that often makes us forget the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias. The unshakeable resolve of Pablo led the Spanish socialists from the founding of PSOE under him and his comrades all the way to the de Rivera dictatorship. Iglesias Posse had to endure prison, poverty and repression for his beliefs, and despite his humble upbringing, produced the theoretical and conventional background to Spanish socialism through his sheer dogged determination towards worker’s liberation and massive productivity in written works.\n\n Pablo Iglesias Posse exemplifies the qualities of a truly conscious Spanish worker, and despite all the differences of ideological orientation that Spanish left-wing activists today possess, we should all unite in celebrating the achievements of Iglesias. As PSOE celebrates its electoral victory, the party leadership has also unveiled a plan to make the birthday of Iglesias Posse into a national holiday, a kind of second First of May, to remember the difficulties Spanish labour faced in its long struggle for worker’s rights, and the men that made it possible."

Others, notably Julian Besteiro himself, have stressed the importance of moderation, highlighting the notable improvements in stability, individual rights and even economic growth that have slowly creeped back into Spain after the horrible anarchy and chaos of the mid-1930s. Still, PSOE was deeply divided between these two battlelines for revolution or continued evolution.\n\n Only the intervention of a deeply surprising figure helped dissipate the tension, as the former staunch revolutionary and admirer of Russian Bolsheviks, Luis Araquistáin, came forth to press the importance of cooperation between Spanish socialists, former republicans and moderate monarchists. He commented that only the peaceful adherence to democracy and curtailment of radical rhetoric will save Spain from another dictatorship or even worse, a full-scale civil war. While in no way a monarchist, Araquistáin considers the monarchy as a necessary concession to the monarchists to maintain the democratic system.\n\n These statements immediately made Araquistáin enemy number one for the revolutionaries within PSOE, but his rhetoric and call for peace convinced many moderates to take a far more dogged stance on the defense of moderation, and even turned some of the more radical PSOE members into adopting a more moderate stance. PSOE is not fully free of tensions, of course, but this newfound commitment to democracy has earned praise from the more centrist parties as well as the king himself."

Besteiro has been an admirer of Karl Kautsky for a long time, and while he did support Russian Revolution due to considering it the only option besides chaos, his opinions on a socialist revolution in Spain have been very different. Like Kautsky, Besteiro considers a socialist revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat to be a childish fantasy, and the syndicalist model of Union of Britain or the French Commune to be incompatible with Spain’s meager industrial base and highly polarized unions.\n\nForming his ideological basis from Revisionist Marxist, Krausist and positivist currents, Besteiro instead believes that Spanish socialists must use the tools of the current democratic system to their advantage, to improve the economic and social conditions of the Spanish workers and peasants, and so that one day the society is ready advance to a socialist system thoroughly. The electoral participation and victories of PSOE inside the democratic system have further strengthened the right-wing of PSOE led by Besteiro.

sprd.154.d:0 "When the republic was proclaimed in 1931 and the oppressive dictatorship was finally overthrown, something within the anarcho-syndicalist movement of CNT-FAI began to change. Previously, the movement had been purely revolutionary in nature, clashing with the SIndicatos Libres, Carabineros and Guardia Civil many times and seeking to one day bring the results seen in France in the aftermath of the Weltkrieg to Spain as well. But as even PSOE adopted some degree of parliamentarism, some within CNT-FAI began to question whether the aggressive rhetoric of the movement was simply harming them. SImilarly, the anti-political nature of CNT-FAI led to them not appearing in elections and thus the trade union and its sister group FAI couldn’t achieve many actual political goals outside of grassroots organization. \n\nMany within CNT began to advocate for a new direction, especially after the domination of FAI began to influence the effectiveness of CNT’s union activities. Eventually, the situation erupted with the Manifesto of the Thirty, that called for CNT-FAI to abandon its anti-political stance and to become a proper, legitimate party participating in elections and the parliamentary system. While the movement failed to shift the direction of CNT-FAI completely, these moderates did manage to cause CNT-FAI to accept the results of the recent elections, and have now pushed more heavily for the movement to stop its terror tactics. \n\nAmong these treintistas, there has even been talks about forming their own party to fully represent the Spanish libertarians and syndicalists in the democratic system, especially now that CNT-FAI has begun to radicalize once more after its election defeat. We could capitalize on this split in the movement and try to convince these moderates to cooperate with us and try to push CNT-FAI off its radicalized platform, as despite all the similar ideas we share with the anarchists, they tend to oppose us more than agree with us, making our position in charge more difficult.

Earlier today, members of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra, UGT’s agricultural section, have protested en masse to the policies of PSOE and UGT, demanding that the government takes direct action towards the difficulties of rural people of Spain. FNTT’s support is critical to the continued governance of PSOE, and similarly earning goodwill among the rural folk would not be a bad thing considering how many of them currently support our rivals on the right, especially in Accion Popular and Partido Agrario. \n\nAs such, conceding to FNTT’s demands, the PSOE government has called for an extra session to tackle the issues. The list of issues is manifold, ranging from lack of proper farming equipment, terrible labour laws leading to excessively lengthy daily hours, poor division of land and the domination of local societies by the so called caciquismos, powerful political machines that keep the Spanish farmer constrained to their economic situation through dirty tactics. While the other issues raised by FNTT representatives will require a much larger agrarian reform, we could focus on the caciquismo for now and destroy their reign in the rural areas. While it won’t magically fix these areas, a bit of well-deserved revenge will make us more popular among the poor people of the farmer communities. Similarly, seizing assets stolen by the political machines from the people will allow us to fund local councils and institutions of FNTT so that they can actually begin making meaningful reforms."

sprd.156.d:0 "When the Russian revolution rose to destroy the imperialist and capitalist order in 1917, the Bolsheviks utilized methods that wholly betrayed the common man and exposed that even the adherents of socialist ideals cannot avoid backsliding into tyranny. While PSOE’s current leader Julian Besteiro supported the Bolsheviks in 1917 due to seeing them as the better alternative to Tsarist tyranny, it is well-known that he shares no love for hardliner communists, despising them almost as much as the right-wing autocrats and traditionalists. This stance, however, is not universally shared within PSOE, and many within the party ranks still harbour ideals close to the Marxist-Leninists despite the defeat of the Bolsheviks. When Besteiro was chosen to lead PSOE, many of these Bolshevizers, as they are known among the socialist party, went on to join other, more extreme left groups, such as the Catalan Bloque Obrero y Campesino and  Izquierda Comunista de España. Yet many still remain, centred around the socialist and communist intellectual newspaper Leviatan, which has long called for a Bolshevik-style revolution in Spain.\n\n If we are to earn the trust of the Spanish people and finally stabilize the situation in Spain, PSOE must eradicate this thorn in its more democratically-minded faction’s side, lest we fall to factionalism and needless bickering, or strengthen the fear mongering of our right-wing rivals. This means that PSOE must persecute even some rather high-calibre members, such as Largo Caballero, who is known to sympathize the Bolshevizers. Yet while this will temporarily hurt us, it is necessary for Spain to finally find its footing and leave the political violence behind."

Then came the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the red scare caused by French and Bolshevik revolutions. Even when the glimmer of hope came with the Second Spanish Republic, it was soon snuffed out by the Sarjurjada coup. In the following purges, Spain was thrusted back into the chaos, ignorance and intolerance to the people’s true will that had dominated it for so long. Yet, we persisted. PSOE continued fighting on, defying the military until the faithful day not long ago, when the military was forced to give in and allow Spain’s people to vote for their chosen champions.\n\n As expected, the overwhelming majority of PSOE and its sister parties bought us the victory, but just as we had to overcome challenges in the last decades to even survive, so too have we had to fight day and night to pass the legislation and policies we want to create the truly equal and free Spain, where no commoner is looked down upon by the plutocrats and clergymen.

UGT collaborated with the dictator, and managed to eke out an existence despite the repressive nature of the regime, but this did mean that its reputation was somewhat tarnished by this collaboration. While CNT was harshly repressed, it did gain the sympathies of those opposing the military dictatorship, and thus has utilized its anti-establishment status to draw supporters away from UGT. However, as PSOE’s status solidifies, UGT leadership has chosen to pursue even deeper ties with our party, seeking a symbiosis similar to that between CNT and FAI, hoping to regain some of its lost pride by associating even more closely with our successful party.\n\n Some within UGT have protested this as muddling union politics with government politics, while PSOE moderates see the UGT’s more radical leadership, especially the current Chairman Largo Caballero, as a threat to PSOE’s new approach. This closer cooperation would also make the more anti-establishement members of UGT uneasy, and they could drop out of the union to go join more radical left unions.

He has historically been so heavily against these groups that many have even questioned if the man is truly a socialist at all, while others with less critical viewpoints have compared him to the Mensheviks of Russia. This has been in contrast to the famous, or infamous, Lenin of Spain, Largo Caballero, even though Caballero himself has many times collaborated with Spain’s dictators himself. Either way, the more moderate stance on socialism has earned him great praise and support, and in the recent elections he swept his more radical rivals by a very clear margin. In a Spain craving for some stability after the dark days, Besteiro has provided an alternative to radicalist demagogues.\n\n However, he himself is torn between various more moderate currents on socialism. While currently Besteiristas lead a large coalition of liberal socialists, Austromarxists and Kautskyites, this has proven to be somewhat of a difficult front to keep, especially in a party already struggling from division between moderates and radicals. As such, Besteiro must now decide upon a certain model of socialism the PSOE shifts towards. Clearest choice is to simply maintain democratic socialism and utilize socialist policies and tools to push policies both through trade unions and parliamentary methods.\n\n Significant support is also provided to the Austromarxist wing of the party argues that in a nation as large and diverse as Spain, the ideas and theories towards nationalism and socialism as unifying forces between central power and minorities could work to counteract dangerous separatism and regionalist ultratraditionalists like the Carlists. Finally, Besteiro could adopt the ideology of his personal favourite socialist theorist, Karl Kautsky, who argued for socialists to adopt a strategy of achieving a transition from capitalism to socialism through working within the capitalist framework and evolving society at large towards a new system, without the need for a costly revolution."

Even though Manuel Azana and many within our party still remember the Republic fondly, the reality of the matter is that the monarchy seems to have come to pass. Still, what the last years of democracy have reminded us of, is that Izquierda Espanola is not the party it was during the republic. With the integration of many regionalist parties, such as Esquierra Catalana and the Galician ORGA, we have slipped further to the left, and while Azana was a committed middle-class republican in the past, the party has evolved beyond that now. We alienated our supporters years ago by trying to push left-leaning reforms on the other hand and holding back on truly embracing the workers. While we are not the socialists of PSOE by any means, we must take heed of the mistakes of the Republic and fully embrace our new role in the Spanish society.\n\nWe can still honour our roots but Izquierda must also look for new partners and new avenues of thought, to finally break free from the memories of the failed Republican projects. As such, Azana and his ministers have announced more radical policy ideas, especially in relation to minority rights of Spain, educational reform, agrarian reform and cultural funding intended to finally break the damage done to Spanish spirit by the likes of Generation of ‘98. But if we are to push through reforms of this magnitude, then we cannot remain a small-scale bourgeois party, but must instead focus our efforts into creating true loyalty to Izquierda Espanola in the masses of people currently supporting other parties, lest they support the likes of Carlists, Catholic zealots or anarchist terrorists."

sprd.161.d:0 "Spanish cultural and intellectual life is very clearly tied to the great national and international events of their time, and our current society is influenced in major way by three distinct generations of writers, artists, intellectuals and politicians, these being the Generation of ‘98, commonly known as Regenerationists, made up of those who saw the fall of the last Spanish colonies outside of Africa, the Generation of ‘14, made up of those who saw the Weltkrieg and the Pistolerismo era, and the Generation of ‘27. Manuel Azana has always been a very outspoken critic of the Generation of ‘98, and now that the new generation is rising to challenge the ideals of the Regenerationist, Izquierda Espanola has pledged to support these new creators of art in their endeavors.\n\nGeneration of ‘27 has been characterized as a merging of Spain’s popular culture with the folklore of Iberia, and while this new movement is hard to break down to its essentials due to the awe-inspiring variety of styles it holds, it is generally considered to be a Spanish embracing of the avant-garde principles promoted usually in various Communards circles. Some styles followed by the Generation include Surrealism, Futurism, Cubism and Ultraism, and the forms of art that have embraced this new generational spirits appear in music, poetry, painting and literature in general, pushed onwards by such savants like Federico Garcia Lorca, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel and K–Hito.\n\nThis new form of artist expression is drawing many eyes towards Spain, especially in a time where Europe itself is focusing on wartime production and other far less artistic pursuits. Izquierda Espanola has long been a defender of Spanish art, and in our pursuit for a more widespread support base, the patronage of this new generation has already helped the party’s support."

sprd.162.d:0 "Spanish regionalists rarely find many allies in the mainline parties of Castile, as both the socialists and conservatives either ignore the regional issues or prefer creating branches of their own ideologies in regions such as Catalonia and Basque Country. However, Izquierda Espanola has historically been quite stalwart ally of regionalist party, with Manuel Azana personally pushing heavily for the proposed Estatuto de autonomía for Catalonia, though this proposition never got off the ground because of the military coup. But now, with the dark days of Sarjurjada a mere memory, our government has decided to push this controversial statute through, with expansion to our allies in Partido Galeguista and Partido Nacionalista Vasca in Galicia and Basque country in addition to Catalan regional reform.\n\nThese autonomous regions will gain a largely independent tax system, and jurisdiction over health and welfare within their regions, with their regional languages fully accepted alongside Spanish in regional matters. While Catalans especially had hoped for a full Catalanization of the region and dropping the requirement for Spanish as an official language, it seems that the concessions have been more than enough. In order to placate regional nationalists, the use of regional flags, such as the Catalan Senyera and Basque Ikurrina, and regional anthems, such as Catalan Els Segadors, has been allowed in official use as well. While this does make Spain less centralized, it does feed into Azana’s personal agenda to fulfill a vision of Spain that is simultaneously one and multiple, fit to the realities of the nation and not to some chauvinistic agenda of a Castilian dominance.\n\nIt has also pushed many parties that would likely otherwise support our rivals into becoming staunch allies of Izquierda Espanola, such as the Basque nationalist or Catalan Lliga Catalunya. Many within Partido Radical have protested this new statute, and Lerroux himself has called it a dangerous mistake that will simply invite separatism, but given their minority in the Cortes, there’s been little they have been able to do."

It is no secret that Izquierda Espanola has struggled heavily in this new situation, given its very clear roots in republicanism, but now that enough time has passed from the painful memory of the republic, it is clear that the new transformation of Izquierda has been a beneficial one.\n\nThe presence of the monarchy and the mistakes done during the Republic era have caused our leadership to reinvent itself to less strictly middle class party with narrow support from petite bourgeois, into a party that is more aligned with the common people. Our alliances with the more radical left-wing parties have made it possible for us to push many of the laws we wished to achieve back in 1931, and thanks to these alliances we have influenced parties like PSOE and Partido Sindicalista to adopt a more democratic form, abandoning their firebrand revolutionary rhetoric. While Spain still has a long way to go to finally becoming a beacon of democracy and progress, thanks to our efforts, we are more prosperous, equal and most importantly, committed to democracy than ever before."

But after so many difficult years and so much suffering inflicted to Spain after the death of the republic, many committed Izquierda republicans have simply become tired. The exile of many republicans, the harsh military repression, the infighting between anarchists, socialists and republicans, all have amounted to very little. The embers of the republican dream still burn in their hearts, but for now, the victory is half-complete. The king has seemingly been committed to democracy within Spain, and while many within IE still abhor the thought of monarchist Spain, even they must admit that the current haven of stability in the usually volatile Spanish politics is a welcome one. So for now, many, Azana included, have offered a peace with the king, to save Spain from itself.

sprd.165.d:0 "General Sarjurjo sat slumped in his chair, glancing at the document on his desk. One of his informants within Izquierda Espanola had sent it to the general earlier today, warning him of an upcoming purge of officers involved in the event known as Sarjurjada, where general Sarjurjo overthrew the republic with the help of Alfonsist funding, Carlist militants and clandestine German and Austrian support. Back then, the republic had been too weak to resist, and now, Sarjurjo could simply scoff at any such pitiful attempts to purge the military. If Azana and his band of troublemakers had been unable to dislodge the powerful Spanish military from its rightful place at the height of Republic’s power, what hope did they have now that the king was in power once more? Sarjurjo grabbed a pen from his desk, beginning to write an order to Guardia Civil to sweep the conspiratory circle of Izquierda Espanola, to root this type of nonsense before it got dangerous enough. However, the pen dropped from the general’s hand as the door was kicked in, and three heavily armed Carabineros soldiers stepped into the rooms, leveling their Star submachine guns at the officer. They were followed by two men in uniform, generals Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer.\n\n Sarjurjo attempted to protest the intrusion, but he was quickly shut down by de Llano, who announced that Cabanellas Ferrer would be taking over as the leader of Guardia Civil starting immediately, and Sarjurjo would be escorted to a military court for his role in the 1932 uprising, especially due to his Carlist connections. As the general was grabbed by the Carabineros, he once more protested, cursing the two other officers for betraying their military brethren so callously. de Llano and Cabanellas Ferrer, known for harbouring republican sentiments, merely scowled at the officer as he was dragged out. The man who had attempted to follow in Primo de Rivera’s shoes had clearly lacked the ability that the former had possessed, the ability to slip out of Spain when the tide had clearly turned against him. Around Spain, similar arrests were carried out, the plotters of Sarjurjada disgraced and expelled from the military, receiving harsh sentiments. Even the monarchy, which they had helped restore, turned a blind eye to them, with the king remembering the role of a puppet his father had been forced into by the ruthless military junta. The greatest threat to Spanish democracy had been removed."

With newfound vigor and purpose, Izquierda Espanola has set upon redeeming the Republic’s legacy by tackling the vast array of issues the 1931 Constitution and bills attempted to rectify. As we set upon this task, however, many within the party have noticed the difference between the Izquierda Republicana of the Republican years and the Izquierda Espanola of today.\n\n With many former Azanistas forced into exile, particularly to the United States, many within our ranks have adopted new ideas, political positions and radical thoughtforms which differ greatly from the positions we had back during the existence of the Republic. IE has visibly shifted to the left even more than before, and while the party used to be a liberal centrist one, it is closer to the PSOE than the Radicals of UE today. As such, many prominent politicians within the party, especially those integrated from smaller parties such as Partido Galeguista and Esquerra Republicana Catalunya, have called for a party convention that would hammer home the new direction of the party. Azana himself supports continuing the current policy of reformist capitalism, but he is also known to exhibit some authoritarian tendencies, especially when it comes to dealing with right-wing extremists, anarchists, the military and Church influence, and thus Azana would likely support adopting an even more iron-gripped style of governance.\n\n Many of the more liberal and pacifist members of the party are disgusted by such proposals, but there are also those who support these lines of thought as necessary within the new monarchist structure. Some have however, offered a middle-ground between the capitalist and authoritarian camps, seeking to bring about American-style progressivism with a Spanish radical stint into the political field of Spain. There are also some smaller, less prominent trains of thought going on within Izquierda Espanola, with Marcelino Domingo from the recently integrated Independent Radical Socialist Party promoting liberal socialism as an alternative to PSOE’s Marxism and UE’s Radicalism. Probably the smallest but still influential group is also the Georgist members of IE and its regionalist support parties, most prominently represented by Blas Infante, who advocate for the adoption of Henry George’s famous single-tax ideology in Spain.

This alliance, while costly and sometimes incredibly cumbersome to uphold, did allow us to make sure that the right-wing parties struggled to gain a majority. Only the backbone of any reactionary action, the military, managed to snatch the reins of progress and governorship from the popular front, and even then the response from the left almost sent the country into a civil war. As Spain continues to heal, and our party has managed to return to its rightful place as the supreme rulers of Spain, the question once again returns, how to contest the ever-present right-wing reactionaries from contesting our rule? Given the existence of the monarchy and the four years of right-wing dictatorship, Spain’s culture has once again steered more towards traditionalism, and thus we must increase our efforts to pry the nation out of this rot, into a brighter dawn.\n\n The idea of a popular front has resurfaced, and we have already sent invitations all over Spain. Most prominent parties are of course Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola, Julian Besteiro’s PSOE and even the moderate syndicalists of Partido Sindicalista and the right-communists of Joaquin Maurin’s BOC. Progressive regionalist parties such as Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Partido Galeguista, ORGA and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya alongside the Basque conservatives and moderate socialists in PNV and ANV respectively have clamoured to join the front as well, seeing us as their best option to enact sufficient regionalist autonomy reforms. Many former republicans, such as the leaders of the Jabali group, Ramon Franco and Blas Infante, have also endorsed the front as a necessary measure to combat the reactionaries under the monarchy. Our overwhelming support should make it easy for the Popular Front to defeat the reactionaries in future elections, although we must not become complacent even with our new political bulwark."

As Spaniards hurried along to their jobs or daily tasks, the street was like a path for ants. Now that Spain’s political situation had stabilized, people had taken to the streets in a new sense of security, no longer burdened by fears of a civil war or spiraling back to the years of pistolerismo like in 1910s and early 1920s. Slowly but surely, Spain was healing, something which made even the usually muted prime minister crack a small smile. However, it quickly dissolved from his face as the red and yellow flags of the Spanish kingdom waved in the light breeze down the street, reminding Azana that even if the threat of a Spanish collapse had been avoided, Spain was still under the grip of the monarchy. Few people in Spain had done as much to achieve the dream of a Spanish republic as Azana, and yet all those dreams had been pummeled into the dirt by the military when the conspiracy of Sarjurjada succeeded and toppled the Second Spanish Republic. The years in exile had not been easy, seeing the dysfunctional Spanish monarchy restored and Spain’s noble people subjected to the tyranny of the military and their lackeys in Accion Popular.\n\n Yet when the inevitable happened and the military was forced to give in before the storm of popular action, a small hope rekindled in the defeated Republicans, and as the exiles were amnestied, Spain saw a true resurgence of democratic will. Yet for Azana, the situation has been difficult to adjust. A life-long republican, he has always seen the monarchy as simply incompatible with truly free, parliamentary democracy, yet as the king has granted his support for democracy and other parties have adopted a more moderate stance towards the monarchy, Azana has had to readjust his beliefs. Even now, as he watches the royal flag of Spain wave, the ex-president of the republic can only think back to the tricolour that once waved over Madrid’s roofs, and the mass fervour of democratization that followed it. Perhaps, even under the monarchy, that spirit could be recreated, nurtured into action through Izquierda Espanola’s policies, and Spain could make the best out of the current situation. Perhaps, the true spirit of 1931 was not completely lost, but simply forgotten, waiting to be discovered once more. Azana sighed and turned back to head into the current session of the Cortes, feeling somewhat revitalized. Spain would know progress, even under the king, if Azana could help it."

The bloated officer corps of the army, prone to corruption, nepotism and conspiratorial reactionarism, has been purged and finally set to a course of a proper modern military, not a semi-feudal clique of rivaling knighthoods, each seeking to beat the other for monetary and political gain. The tyrant Sarjurjo has been judged before the law, and his allies in the military have not escaped our wrath.

After all, even during the days of the Republic, Union Republicana was always a negotiator between the various republican parties, so perhaps the new Union Espanola can continue this legacy.

After all, the fall of France and the weakness of remaining French radicals does put us as one of the strongest radical parties left in the world, but there are still many around the globe who support the ideals of the original Jacobinism. The time looks ripe for the rebirth of the Radical Entente, to fully align the world’s radicals under one banner and resist the vile autocratic monarchs and devious syndicalists.

Now, however, Spanish democracy has existed for a long time, and our support has grown to the point that we may finally be able to finish off the relic holding us in the past. Martinez Barrio has announced the reinstitution of the Republican secular laws.\n\nThe Catholic Church will be barred from holding any stakes in industry or commerce, the state subsidies to clergy will be entirely cut within two years of the law passing and any religious entities that require an oath of allegiance to any other institution than the state itself will be banned entirely from the nation. This final point would mainly target Jesuits. Further investigations into church properties will be taken, and those considered unnecessary for religious use will be nationalized so that they may be used for the benefit of society. Similarly, the state will be able to veto appointments made by the church within its organization, to curtail the appointment of anti-democratic or fundamentalist clergymen. There are some limitations to the legislation we can push through, however, as the king is obviously quite heavily connected to the church, and even though the monarchy abandoned its reactionary role in previous dictatorships, the weakening of the church role is still a sore spot for them.

After all, over the border, the meddlesome syndicalists also claim to be heirs to Jacobinism, which we wholesale reject.\n\nFanning the Francophobia that has taken hold over Spain during the primoderiverista era, we could gain support even from our rivals and enemies as few legal parties in Spain openly support the Communard regime. This support could later earn us some goodwill as we push more radical reforms, such as the secularisation of the Spanish state. As such, while many within our party leadership are not as dedicated to nationalism as their Partido Radical counterparts, in this instance we must fully leverage the anti-French rhetoric in our manifestos and political speeches.

sprd.175.d:0 "After the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista in 1934, Diego Martinez Barrio and Felix Gordón Ordás have laboured to bridge the differences these two parties have had towards policy. While both parties showed a perhaps too overzealous attitude towards achieving secularization in the past, they have now been forced to shift their perspectives towards more practical fields, such as economy and agrarian reform. This has led to some friction before the former Radical-Socialists and Radical Democrats, as while the two parties share some common ideas, especially those among the ranks of the Radical-Socialists tend to veer more to the left in economic issues. As such, a party convention has been called to fully mend party divides and choose a line that our new union must follow.\n\nThe supporters of Martinez Barrio espouse the following of Radical liberalism and moderate cooperation between parties, while the followers of Gordón Ordás promote a society built on progressive values and moderation between parties, upholding democracy as the paramount value of the entire society. This line is seen as a more conservative stance on matters than their more radical opponents within the PRRS wing of UR, who instead promote the adoption of a liberal variant of socialism. Led by Álvaro de Albornoz, this wing of the former PRRS denounces Marxism, but promotes the adoption of more radical methods inside UR, borderlining on veering into Izquierda Espanola’s rhetoric at times. They are also more willing to work with left-wing parties such as PSOE.\n\nFourth option, coming out of left field for many, is the adoption of the ideology promoted by the Czech National Socialist Party. Circulo Espanol del Praga, and it’s Spanish counterpart, La Agrupacion de Amigos de Checoslovaquia,  a collection of Czech and Spanish intellectuals and notable members of their society have long been in a cultural exchange, despite the sad state of Czech independence movement. As the republican movements of Czechia and Spain had a lot in common, our radicals naturally intermingled in these sorts of organizations, and thus many within UR are aware of the style of liberal radicalism the Czechs espouse. This “National Socialism” promoted by the likes of T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, is not massively known in Spain, but could prove to be a good common ground to unite our fragmented party around, due to its focus on civic nationalism, moderate socialism and liberal spirit."

sprd.176.d:0 "Union Espanola is a relatively new party, formed in 1934 after the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista. Both of these two groups used to be part of the larger Partido Radical Republicana, led by the infamous silver-tongued demagogue Alejandro Lerroux, and the main cause for the split was the increasing caudilloism of Lerroux and his constant compromising with the right-wing parties of Spain, especially those that were clearly very pro-church in nature. Now that Union Espanola has shown itself to be the stronger of the two radical parties of Spain, we must launch a full investigation into Lerrouxist degeneracy and corruption, just to keep them on their toes and to weaken our strongest opponent. Still, this merging of PRRS and PRD has not been easy, and while we are united in cause to decimate the Lerrouxist false radicals, the frictions inside UE are beginning to mount. In order to properly fix the damage done to radicalism by those who sought to corrupt it, UE must adopt a unified vision, and do so soon."

sprd.177.d:0 "As radicals, Union Espanola has always been committed to the ideals of the French revolution and the legacy of the Jacobins, as well as the wider ideals developed afterwards by radical liberals worldwide. However, the unique nature of Spain means that UE must compromise on the centralist nature of radical liberalism if we are to avoid the ire of the minorities. After all, we participated in the Pact of San Sebastian, guaranteeing the rights of Spanish minorities with our signature. Moving to a less exclusively anti-regionalist direction would probably earn us a great deal of goodwill among the minor peoples of Spain, especially as their most popular parties in turn tend to be rather pro-Republican. This move could possibly also align the various smaller sections of Lerroux’s Radicals closer to us, making integration of these autonomous parties easier when the time comes to take action towards them. While UE will never reach as strong a stance towards minorities as the Azanistas, we will implement new policies aimed at safeguarding the autonomy and cultural priviledges of the Spanish minorities.."

sprd.178.d:0 "Spanish political scene tends to be perceived only at the national level or through some select regionalist parties such as the Basque PNV or Catalan ERC, but especially since the abandonment of the two-party system and the proclamation of the republic, local-level parties have propped up at an incredible rate. Often these parties operate within a single territory of Spain, or at best in the surrounding provinces, but they nonetheless often wield such an influence that even state-level parties must pay heed to their demands. Partido Radical, our old rivals, have swayed two such parties to their side, these being the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista and the Granadan Partido Republicano Autónomo de Granada.\n\nö PURA represents the left flank of PR’s autonomous parties, while PRAG has long tried to position themselves further from the main party due to various internal changes of Partido Radical. While they may not see eye to eye with Union Espanola on all issues, we could seek to integrate them into our organization in the future, especially as many PURA members have already joined us in the past. Another splinter of the Lerrouxist Radicals is also the small Catalan party, Partit Radical Autònom de les Comarques Tarragonines. Due to their Catalan roots, the party has slowly drifted away from Lerrouxism and into the arms of Catalan nationalists, but thanks to our evolution into less outwardly hostile party towards the Spanish minorities, we could attempt to woo this party into joining us. However, many within our party believe that if we are to absorb these smaller regional groups, it could lead to a slide towards different ideological basis, especially with the Blasquismo of PURA."

sprd.179.d:0 "Spanish schools have been in decline for ages now, struggling with funding and poisoned by the reactionary agenda of the Catholic church. Jesuits and monastic clergy have infiltrated our school system thoroughly, and the role of the church in education is immense, with many schools being completely under church ownership. This, simply cannot stand. Union Espanola has begun a massive operation to nationalize all Catholic school, though this is not as simple as it seems. Many of our teachers are nuns or monks, and while they cannot be blamed for the nefarious plans of the Papacy and its henchmen, they must be replaced with reliable, secular teachers.\n\n This is going to be costly, but there are ways we can cover for the costs. The moderate approach would be to slowly phase out church education as we educate new secular teachers, but this will compromise on our campaign promises and will obviously take time. The other option is to charge rent from church properties and use those funds to pay for the needed wages for teachers as well as the educational costs of training new teachers. This would likely anger the church and parties like Accion Popular, but considering our anti-clerical policies already being drafted, such as the reform to divorce laws and civil marriages, this little concession would probably not help our standing with Vatican."

sprd.180.d:0 "As DLE returns to the Spanish political scenes after years of hibernation and exile, the leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora has been questioned by many. Especially further right from us, some within the Accion Popular and especially among the radicals of Partido Nacional Espanola and Renovacion Espanola have protested his nomination, claiming that Spain will only relive the events of 1931-1932, with the socialists and radical liberals like Azana seeking to dismantle Spain’s traditions and culture. They claim that the moderate stance of Alcala-Zamora only invites further radicalization, and his willingness to compromise with the left while holding conservative stances on other matters will simply lead to him becoming the Spanish Kerensky, inviting a terrible civil war because of his compromises. DLE’s supporters have struck back, claiming that it was only the compromises between republicans, socialists and even monarchists that allowed Spain to pass by the dark days of last few years, directly a result of Accion Popular’s disastrous policies. Nonetheless, even the rabid monarchist elements have a seed of truth in their ramblings, and it is true that Spanish republicans did go overboard in the fervor of liberalization in the faithful days of the Second Republic. We must learn from these mistakes and carve out a path where we can both appeal to the liberals, conservatives and moderates within our party without compromising too much with the rabid firebrands of Azanistas or Gil-Robles’ goons. DLE is the only party that can truly bring moderate progress to Spain, without the corruption of Lerrouxists or the radical ideology of the other parties. Just like Kerensky turned out to be the compromise candidate for Russia, so too shall Alcala-Zamora lead Spain into a moderate dawn, though the Spanish Kerensky shall avoid the mistakes of his namesake, and hopefully, the fate of him as well."

sprd.181.t:0 "The Maurists Return!"
sprd.181.d:0 "After our defeat in 1932 during Sarjurjada, Derecha Liberal Republicana had a crisis within its leadership as Antonio Maura’s son, Miguel Maura, led a part of the party with him to form Partido Republicano Conservador. This move was primarily fueled by Maura blaming the policies of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his close allies for destroying the republican dream by allying with socialists and liberals. Maurists instead wished to focus their efforts on the original dreams of DLR, creating a mass movement of non-confessional republicans who would ease Spaniards into the new state of things. With Spain stabilizing and DLR’s new successor, DLE, returning to conservatism with a liberal and progressive tinge, Maura has offered to rejoin our party if DLE does not continue its policy of dangerous alliances with the left. Given that Maura’s father was basically the founder of modern Spanish conservatism, having him and possibly his brother Gabriel Maura joining us instead of Accion Popular would boost DLE’s profile to previously unattainable heights. This does mean that any coalitions with Azanistas are ruled out, but we have already begun negotiations with conservative parties in the minority regions, such as Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, Irmandades da Fala in Galicia, Union Navarra in Navarre and Partido Nacionalista Vasco in Basque Country, as well as the Union Espanola of Diego Martinez Barrio, and hopefully we can form a large coalition without the need for Azana’s support."

sprd.182.t:0 "The Debate on Conservatism"
sprd.182.d:0 "Derecha Liberal Republicana was always balancing between its two main factions, the liberal left and the conservative, Christian democrat right, and this struggle for control within the party eventually led to its weakened position in parliamentary politics. As we have returned to the Cortes in force, this issue of just what style of conservatism our new party should follow has been raised once more. There are multiple options to choose from, the easiest one obviously being that we could simply continue our curious mix of progressive and conservative policies, seeking to create a moderately Catholic state with wide popular support. However, if we were to lean more into the masses, we could also adopt even more populist tactics to create a truly mass party, less focused on the typical liberal businessmen and academics as we now do, replacing this side with more grassroots activity. This would likely put us at odds with the Lerrouxists and Accion Popular, who focus on workers and peasants respectively, but given the radicalism of those two parties, perhaps taking part of their voter based would be good for Spain. Alternatively, we could lean even more into the liberal side of our party, seeking to empower the business sector and political elite, while still maintaining our focus on civil liberties, societal progress and slight Christian tint.\n\n Yet the possibilities do not stop there, as we could also adopt the ideology of the newly integrated Partido Republicana Conservador, Maurism, named after their mentor Antonio Maura. This would see us abandon some of our more liberal principles and adopt some elements of protectionism, but it would nonetheless keep the party mostly progressive conservative in societal and economic matters. Finally, we could simply adopt Christian democracy wholesale, turning our movement more socially conservative. This shift would likely help us boost our numbers while hurting Accion Popular, which is always a nice bonus."

sprd.183.d:0 "Spain has long suffered instability of the highest order, and its many parties and organizations have done little to calm this raging inferno of political polarization down. Yet just like in 1931 Niceto Alcala-Zamora brought a storm down upon himself for resisting radical anti-clericalism of the constitution, so too will DLE now stand up and fight for what is right and just, even if it means becoming the target of both left and right radicals. Spain has been tortured for so long that Spaniards themselves consider these constant crises normal, yet this must end. A political purge will be enacted within DLE to rid us of any possible warmongers and radicals, and after that, we must establish new legislation and juridical procedures to make persecuting violent or revolutionary political activists easier.\n\n Similarly, we will use one of our best contacts in the military, Major General Carlos Blanco Pérez. He happens to be a member of our party, and has provided information to us about those military officers most likely to align with both revolutionary actors aligned with the Internationale or traditionalist fundamentalists of Renovacion Espanola and the Carlists. Another military officer, general Quiepo de Llano, has also collaborated with DLE on this matter, partly because of his former republican sympathies and partly because of him being Alcala-Zamora’s son-in-law. With these two links within the army, we can finally curtail radicalism spreading within the military, and allow us to focus our energy on political and revolutionary actors who aren’t tied to it. While these actions are not particularly popular even inside DLE, they are necessary to finally exorcize the demon of political extremism that has haunted Spain for so long."

sprd.184.t:0 "Building Bridges Between Fellow Conservatives"
sprd.184.d:0 "Historically, many regionalist parties have tended to align with Manuel Azana’s Izquerdistas because of their very pro-regionalist policies, but this cooperation has very often been mired by the IE’s very radical anti-clericalism, while many large regionalist parties tend to have at least some degree of Catholic factionalism. Some, like the Basque PNV, are Christian democratic parties, who in the past supported republicans simply because of their preference for pro-autonomy policies. Now, as DLE gathers steam after the electoral victory, we could capitalize on the differences between IE and its regional allies. As DLE has leaned more into pro-Catholic policies, many local parties are seeking to align with us, but they are cautious on whether we support their calls for autonomism or prefer centralism in Spain. Centralization is preferred by many monarchists and nationalists in Spain, but it would be an understatement to say that they dislike us, so we would likely not lose much by pursuing more autonomist policies.\n\n Preliminary talks with PNV and the Catalan right-wing parties such as Liga Regionalista and Unio Democratica de Catalunya have been promising, and large Galician parties such as Dereita Galeguista and Partido Galeguista have also contacted us offering support in exchange for preferential policies. This would allow us to dislodge Azana’s party as the leader of pro-autonomism, and given the Spanish Radical parties’ preference for centralization, they would likely not gain many votes from the minorities either. As such, the party leadership has decided to focus on legislation that would support the culture and rights of Spanish minorities, especially after so many years of oppressive military crackdowns and Castilian cultural chauvinism. Thus, these new policies are basically just one more step on our road to becoming a true mass party for all Spaniards."

sprd.185.d:0 "DLE, in its initial form, was very much a republican party, and while we were committed to moderatism just as fervently back in 1931 as we are now, monarchism was never dominant within the party. However, as it currently stands, the monarchy was restored and while many within the party still hold up hopes that it could be destroyed and the monarchist flags torn down, the truth is that for the time being, the republican tricolor is not going to fly over Spain any time soon.\n\n As surprising as it may be Niceto Alcala-Zamora and other members of the party, such as Miguel Maura, used to be monarchists once. While they abandoned those convictions due to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the disgraceful abandonment of the Spanish people by the monarchy that happened during those years, they have now warmed up towards the monarchy thanks to the new constitutional transformation of it and renewed commitment to democracy.\n\n It is clear that DLE will most likely never match the sheer monarchist ferocity of Accion Popular or Renovacion Espanola, our monarchism will be tempered, pragmatic and most importantly, fiercely democratic, something that even the most moderate Accion Popular members could not claim in all honesty. With the DLE’s republicanism kept under a lid or possibly completely extinguished, the party will nonetheless push through the policies of the original republican dream, just fit for the new system."

In a peninsula filled to the brim with tyrants, radicals, terrorists and separatists, a seed of hope has been slowly nurtured, our moderate policies allowing it slowly recover and grow to its full potential, and now, the Spanish Kingdom stands united.\n\n The dark years, or more accurately, decades, have finally been redeemed, with the painful memories slowly fading and the scars disappearing. Without DLE’s firm but gentle hand, Spain may have very well fallen into a nosedive towards a civil war despite all the compromises and victories of 1936 and 1937. But DLE has managed to pacify those elements of the Spanish society that would not see reason, and moderate those that could. With our politics slowly but surely turning less and less polarized, Spain’s democracy may finally be allowed to thrive and grow, to reach its full potential as it was always meant to be.

As such, Spain has never truly seen a proper, democratic constitutional monarchy, where parties are free to take part in elections and compete against each other in a truly parliamentary way. Neither was there really a party calling for such a thing while also advocating for the monarchy, if we discount the accidentalist mindset of the Republic-era Spanish right. But under the transformative leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his strong allies under Miguel Maura, Spain has seen this style of governorship finally become possible, as the party expands its ranks with new, young patriots, seeking progress alongside the long traditions of the monarchy and the moderate democratic process. Thanks to our efforts, the Spanish people are getting more and more used to democracy and its characteristics, and slowly, it is developing into something that political parties across the isle see as fundamental part of our society. While much work remains to be done, we can be proud in the achievements completed so far."

As Spain develops to a shining beacon of liberal democracy in Europe, around the world’s nations this is far from the norm. The Entente is slowly slipping to autocracy, the American peoples’ are tearing each other apart, the German order is far from a paradise of democracy and the Syndicalists themselves have violently overthrown their rightful governments, and harbour dangerous radicals like Mosley, Mussolini and Valois. In Asia, Japan seeks to dominate the poor Chinese, destroying any sense of unity they could possibly achieve.\n\n Bleakness of today’s world is on a level that is completely unacceptable to DLE’s leadership, and while far from the most jingoistic Spaniards, our party leadership understands that Spain must serve its role in the liberation of the world from the shackles of tyranny, be it reactionary or revolutionary. While we prepare the Spanish nation to take a more active part in this fight for freedom, liberty and democracy, we must create the means to defend Spain’s borders from any incoming force. Extensive fortifications will be constructed in the Basque country and Catalonian border with France, and reserve units will be circulated along the Spanish coast in preparation for a naval invasion.\n\n The Spanish people must stand ready to face the storms of the world, for the protection of liberty and our free system is of utmost importance. Factories like Star, Llama and Oviedo Mauser plants will be churning out guns, ammunition and other military equipment for domestic use, but we will also create a program aimed at supplying friendly regimes in their conflicts, for if they fall, our fall will be more likely as well. And finally, a clandestine group of volunteers and military experts will be assembled to provide direct intervention forces, mostly working without national symbols, to help our allies overseas against dictators and power-hungry madmen.

Yet, we have been more successful at promoting truly democratic monarchism to the masses, as AP’s actions during the dictatorship showed their true colours to many Spanish right-wing monarchists. This has driven many minor parties, such as the agrarian parties Unión Castellana Agraria, Acción Agraria Riojana, the more traditionalist yet somewhat progressive Dereita Galeguista and Unión Navarra and the numerous smaller liberal centrist parties, such as Partido Republicano Liberal Demócrata, Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Partido del Centro Democrático, into seeking an alliance or perhaps outright integration into our party. While this could help bolster out ranks and allow us to more easily defeat Accion Popular on the battlefield of parliamentarism, it would also cause our party to be ripped into different directions without considerable reorganization. As such, while many see integration of these parties as the utmost task of DLE at the moment, yet others, Miguel Maura among them, urge for caution.

Through our resolute but gentle action, Spanish people are more committed to the values of democracy than ever before, and many of those who once sought to bring Spain to a civil war and revolution have calmed their rhetoric and joined us on the parliamentary stage as rivals, not as violent enemies. Spanish culture, economy and academia blossoms as the violence of the last few years fades away, and for the first time in ages, the atmosphere of fear has vanished, replaced by a sense of pride and hope for the future, of a Spain made anew by the actions of responsible governance. While the current world order fluctuates, Spain must find its own place among it, but for now, we stand ready for the challenges the global politics will throw our way. Spain is united, moderate and stable, and for now, DLE can enjoy its place at the forefront of this change. However, as our party has continued to evolve, many have accused us of harbouring elitist sentiments, not helped by the rather laissez-faire outlook on economics that many within DLE hold. As the party attracts new blood into its ranks, many within the press and academic field have observed that DLE has slowly started shedding some of the more elitist members, both due to natural progression and partially as a concentrated appeal from DLE leadership. How this will shape the party remains to be seen, but it is certainly changing the landscape of its internal politics dramatically."

While the old king recovered from his coma, he was wise enough to not contest the rule of his son, who has proven to be far more adept at seeing things as they are. As the current monarch is less blind to the issues of average Spaniards, or at the very least is attempting to care about them, DLE has decided to support the royal house fully, though less fervently as our rivals in the Accion Popular or Partido Nacional Espanola. Just as the monarchy still has long ways to go before the average Spaniards starts viewing them with less contempt, so does DLE have to go through quite a bit of internal restructuring to adjust to this new pro-monarchy stance, even when it comes to old monarchists like Niceto Alcala-Zamora. Nonetheless, should the monarchy receive the support of a former republican party, it would likely heighten its changes at being recognized as legitimate in the eyes of Spain’s people, though even then we must understand that the process of reconciliation will take time, and the republican flame may never be truly extinguished.

The path ahead to reconquer that which has been lost to time and rivaling powers will take time, but as Spain steams ahead, seemingly recovering from the dark days of the past, Accion Popular continues to grow to its role as the citadel of Spain’s monarchism. Other parties may nibble at our support base, but this will only make us stronger as it removes those of little faith from our ranks. Already, Spaniards are becoming more charitable and caring for those in need, abandoning the greed of unfettered capitalism and the false promises of syndicalism and finding the true path to good life in God and service to Spain’s eternal institutions. While Accion Popular must continue its progress of adjusting to the new and developing Spain, we have proven that Spain, eternal Espana, still has quite a bit of fight left in her, and while the days of the Empire have long passed, through Accion Popular’s actions, perhaps she can rise to new heights once more.

However, now that we have returned to the political scene, radicalized by the slow progress of reforms, overt political Catholicism of the military regime and the presence of our old monarchist rivals on the Spanish throne once more, PR must take a swift policy shift towards these monarchists. We cannot tolerate monarchist sympathies that would draw us closer to Accion Popular, because to associate with that party would be associating with those that ruined the Republic.\n\n Instead, those monarchists that insist on remaining in our party, such as the prominent Restoration era politician Santiago Alba, must be converted to be true Radicals. Partido Radical must not slip back to its complacent moderate position, we are a party of action first and foremost and to slowly drift towards monarchism would be the death knell to our party. The monarchists of PR will accept our new political positions or leave, probably to join the DLE or the cursed Accion Popular, yet to get rid of these wolves in sheep’s clothing will only strengthen our party.

Few parties in Spain have been so rife with corruption, grift and embezzlement as Partido Radical, and scandals such as the Straperlo affair of 1934, where the nephew of Alejandro Lerroux was caught trying to influence Accion Popular politicians to accept the legalization of fixed roulette. Accion Popular used this affair as a way to blackmail Radicals and republicans in general, and the fallout left Partido Radical reeling for quite some time. While it did enact a small purge within the party, the rate of corruption within PR is incredibly difficult to fully root out, and many of our senior politicians, such as Rafael Salazar Alonso and Moreno Calvo, have been implicated in many corruption and bribery cases.\n\n The party leader Alejandro Lerroux has managed to remain free of these scandals thus far, but his shady dealings in ruling his personal fiefdom, the street of Paraleo in Barcelona, a notable hive of scum and villainy, have made him very suspicious to law enforcement agents, at least those not in his pocket at the moment. However, while sweeping the party clean of corrupt grifters would probably make it better at doing, well, its job as governors of the Spanish people, one could also argue that the election victory implicates that no change is needed. After all, Spanish people have lived under the corrupt military regime for almost two decades now, and while Lerroux’s party has many that enjoy the finer things in life, assisted by generous ‘political interest groups’, they can’t be as ridiculously corrupt as the military, after all?\n\n However, many within Lerroux’s inner circle have argued that we must instead turn the accusations to our strength, purge the party of worst offenders and return to the golden days of the pre-Primo de Rivera era, when Lerroux was known as a firebrand populist, willing to use methods other parties didn’t have the guts to, bringing radical change to Spain even if it meant taking or giving a few bribes here and there to achieve."

sprd.195.d:0 "With the party cleaned of corrupt hacks like Rafael Salazar Alonso, Juan Pich y Pon, Miguel Galante and Eduardo Benzo, we have now started working towards reforming the party towards a wholly new path. This has obviously greatly weakened our party in the short term, but in the long term the damage done to PR’s reputation may finally be repaired and our pride restored. However, now that we have stripped the party from many of its most prominent members, the question remains, where do we go from here? Obvious answer would be a return to radical liberalism, allowing us to perhaps integrate Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola in the future, but many also view this as too similar to them in case they want to retain the parties as separate entities, and thus it would likely lead us to bleeding voters to UE in the future as well. Others have instead argued that we should adopt the ideology of our smaller regional party,  the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista. PURA was, at its infancy, dominated by one man, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, whose ideology was in broad strokes similar to that of Partido Radical, but in reality much more in touch with the local population, and some would argue, more linked to regionalism. However, this is not the case, as while the party maintains a very Valencian nature, they still promote Spanish nationalism same as PR, and fight back against Catalan separatism. The party is noted for its heavy use of grassroots populism, and at times, direct political action even in the form of violence to achieve its goals. This could give us a truly reinvigorating perspective into governance. But these are not the only options. Others yet have argued that we should retain some elements of our former moderate outlook during the  Republican years, and instead lean more towards Classical liberal ideals, to appease the growing middle-class support of PR over our working-class supporters in Barcelona. However, this will again hurt our support somewhat as many workers will see this as betrayal of PR’s core values."

sprd.196.d:0 "Now that the small matter of party corruption has been brushed aside, we can start working on various minor ventures the party has been attempting to pass for quite some time. One of these is a mission that was started ages ago but never completed, a shipping route between Fernando Poo, Río Muni and Annobón, using the Spanish West Africa Company. This would greatly help with colonial affairs and future colonial projects should we hope to advance further into Central Africa in the inevitable case of German colonial collapse. However, although the project is paid for, there is a matter of Antonio Nombela, who our informants claim is planning to snitch out on this project. Given that we had to grease quite a few wheels to get the West Africa Company to sign the papers, this is obviously unacceptable.\n\n As Partido Radical is looking to tap into the potential of African colonial trade, especially given the very destabilized nature of Mittelafrika’s law enforcement, we must get the trade route up and running, and having some upstart colonial enforcer stepping out of his role to snoop in the business is too risky. We could obviously just dismiss him, but other party members consider this too likely to get spotted by authorities, so there has been suggestions to fabricate an accident for the man or to implicate him for some crime that would get him locked off for some time, giving us time to pull this colonial venture through."

sprd.197.d:0 "Lerrouxismo started off as a derogatory term for the followers of Partido Radical Republicana, its detractors seeing the party as a group of ruffians and troublemakers following a violent and corrupt demagogue. While in parts, this could be considered true, these insults were mostly coming from Catalan anarchists and separatists who were seeking to leave the glorious nation of Spain to form their own breakaway state, so one could claim they were not in a position to hurl such claims.\n\n However, while the term Lerrouxismo is infamous, the promises of such ideology tend to appeal to many young and radical men, especially those who live in the regions dominated by one of Spain’s many minority groups, for example the cities of Bilbao and Barcelona. These men, brought to these cities due to their growing industrial might, found themselves surrounded by foreign language, foreign culture and hostile attitudes towards Spaniards, all because these virtuous men wanted to continue working for the betterment of Spain. Lerroux provided a voice for them, denouncing the Catholic church feeding lies to them and the separatist scum looking down upon them for being loyal to the true ruler of Iberia, the Spanish state. Lerroux’s closeness to the people, easily achievable due to his control over the famous entertainment street, Paraleo of Barcelona, allowed him to use his populist rhetoric and radical ideas to reach the Spanish patriots and use them to break those who would seek to break Spain apart or to the ignorance of old, be they anarchists, socialists, separatists or church lackeys. \n\nHis violent anti-clericalism and anti-syndicalism inspired many to fight the good fight against forces hostile to Spanish nature. But throughout the years, Lerroux lost some of his fire. The republic’s initial reforms went against his beliefs, pushing him to ally right-wing parties and compromise with the Catholics. Fighting the radicalism of his fellow republicans, PRR adopted moderatism, but given that the Republican experiment was cut short by the military jackals, perhaps it’s time to light the fire of Lerrouxismo again. As we did back in 1910s, we shall act now, serving as a vanguard of modernity, its noble barbarians bringing the fight to church backwardness, socialist lies, separatist delusion and anarchist degeneracy alike. Lerrouxismo will burn bright once more, and all of Spain will be purified in its flame"

While the dictator may have been a tyrant, at least his response to the Catalan devils was appropriate. Now, Catalan separatists once more conspire with the anarchists of CNT-FAI, and Spanish unity is at risk.\n\n Running battles between the police and emboldened Catalan separatists from Estat Catala, Nosaltras Sols and Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana-Estat Català are almost daily occurrences, and Guardia Civil is working overtime in pursuing leads about suspected separatist holdouts. More muscle is needed to bring this insidious movement down, and the history of Partido Radical may have the answer ready. Back in the end of 1910s, Lerrouxist republicans participated in an organization called Liga Patriótica Española, an ad hoc organization consisting of Carlist workers, police and military men, Mellistas and even football hooligans from the club Real Club Deportivo Espanyol de Barcelona. These mixed units faced down Catalan nationalists on the streets, battering sense into their stubborn heads. While making such a broad coalition can be damaging to our reputation in the short term, the hit to our image is a small price to play to finally put the Catalan nationalists down for good."

Yet Catalonia is also by far the most politically active region in Spain, and while Lerroux is no friend of their people, he recognizes that many Catalans share the same republican values that Partido Radical holds so dear, and while the republican dream might be dead, or at least lost for the time being, republicans in current days Spain must stick together.\n\n So, while it will be an incredibly unpopular move inside the party and cause Partido Radical to hemorrhage voters, Lerroux has no option but to ease on the crackdowns and grant some of the concessions towards autonomy that the Catalans have been demanding, sometimes violently. While these concessions will not be the regionalist-loving softness of Izquierda Espanola or the moderate regionalism of Union Espanola, they will nonetheless be a massive policy shift for Partido Radical, and one we must recover from in other areas to avoid total party collapse."

And with our new policy set, we can only go further from here, fighting back our enemies and reaffirming our ties with our allies. While the monarchy is a bitter setback to our Republican aims, at the very least the situation is better than under the iron boot of the military and their incompetent lackeys in Accion Popular, and while we must bend to the rules of the monarchy and cannot pursue quite as radical of a platform as many within Partido Radical would want, with the help of popular will we can at least shape Spain towards the future we wish, one united under Spanish nationalism, direct action and rationality over superstition."

sprd.201.d:0 "Alejandro Lerroux is a man of many talents and known for his fierce political rhetoric and commandeering presence, but those alone can only take a man so far. A true source of power for Lerroux has almost always been his knowledge of connecting with the working man, which has allowed him to exploit the fears and dreams of the common man to achieve enough political capital for his political goals. His connection to the average Spaniards was partially due to his control over the street of Paralelo, one of the main streets of Barcelona known for its theatres, cabarets and circuses.\n\n The significance of Paralelo is immense, as the street rivals many of the famous entertainment centres of the world, such as London’s West End, New York’s Broadway and Paris’ Montmartre, housing such renowned venues such as El Molino concert hall, Teatro-Circo Olympia circus and Talía Theatre. The street may be a source of great art, but it is also rife with drug use, prostitution and organized crime, leading it to have a very two-faced appearance. This duality, however, has allowed Lerroux to connect with elites and workers alike, as his grip on the street has been absolute until the Catalans drove him out temporarily, but he returned in force and his political machine became synonymous with the night-life of Paralelo, granting him the nickname ‘Emperor of Paralelo’.\n\n Now, the Emperor of Paralelo labours under the Spanish king, but he has not forgotten his roots in the dirt of that Catalan street, and as Lerroux continues his crackdown on Catalan separatism, Paralelo serves as his castle to rule the realm of Barcelona from, the Emperor’s agents hunting down separatists and anarchists alike."

Now, however, seeing how corrupted the previous one-party regime of Accion Popular became with the church dominating much of its decisions, Lerroux’s anti-clericalism has been reignited, and in a historic gathering held in the main plaza of Barcelona, he returned to one of his original speeches, first written in the start of the century, yet to him, as important as ever. In the speech, he addressed many young radicals, committed anti-clericals and fierce streetfighters, saying:\n\n ‘Young barbarians of today: enter and sack the decadent civilization of this unhappy country, destroy its temples, finish off its gods, tear the veil from its novices and raise them up to be mothers to virilize the species, break into the records of property and make bonfires of its papers that fire may purify the infamous social organization. Enter its humble hearths and raise the legions of proletarians that the world may tremble before their awakened judges. Do not be stopped by altars nor by tombs. Fight, kill, die’\n\n The announcement was followed by hysterical action in the crowd, as they were caught in the fervour of the speech, but for the rest of Spain’s political scene, the announcement was met with mixed reactions. Accion Popular, Partido Nacional Espanola and Derecha Liberal Republicana denounced such violent demagoguery and claimed that Lerroux would only push Spain back to the chaos of the last decade once more. Izquierda Espanola and both socialists and syndicalists, traditional enemies of Lerroux, on the other hand, have given cautious support to this new policy of rabid anti-clericalism, though they still remain unconvinced whether Lerroux will stay true to his principles."

Officially, the party and the king maintain a facade of courteous co-existence, but under the surface the king and his prime minister butt heads almost constantly, even on minor matters, as Lerroux refuses to acknowledge any authority of the crown and views the institution of monarchy as merely a relic of the past that should be reserved for ceremonial occasions only. However, the party’s small but influential monarchist wing, still around despite the crackdown earlier in PR’s history, has argued that brokering a power-sharing deal with the king could be beneficial for Lerrouxists as it would end the needless stalemate that continues to harm PR’s image and prevents alliances with moderate monarchists such as the members of DLE. However, thus far Lerroux has brushed such ideas aside, claiming that as long as he draws breath, Radical party shall remember the crimes the monarchists committed on the republic. Nonetheless, the deadlock with the king is weighing on the aging prime minister, and should other Radicals pressure him on the matter as well, Lerroux could be negotiated to compromise with the king on a cease-fire."

Its many issues remain, yet despite all the shady dealings and connections with the underworld of Spain, the immensely firebrand rhetoric of Lerroux and his increasing levels of populism, Partido Radical has returned to Spanish politics in force, much to the dismay of monarchists, syndicalists, separatists and clergy alike. Few parties in Spain, or even in the world, could be viewed as quite so controversial as Lerroux’s radicals, yet his near-personality cult level of influence has allowed the silver-tongued demagogue to capture hearts of Spain’s workers and middle class alike, creating a bulwark of radicalism that follows Lerroux’s commands even with all the baggage the man carries behind him. The Emperor of Paralelo now carries a new moniker, the Radical Caudillo, and in his wake a new Spain rises, one with almost as many contradictions and complicated webs of connections as the man leading it."

However, it is clear that the German proxy state of Morocco has been funding these rebels for years now, both in Rif and in the colonial holdings of Nationalist France. Even during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship there were plans to destabilize Morocco and invade it, though the threat of a German reprisal kept even the fiercest warmongers in check. However, with German economy shattered, its mega-colony of Mittelafrika bursting at seams and the ever-present threat of French and Russian revanchist attacks, Germany cannot support its Maghreb puppet as efficiently as it once could. As we have grown stronger, the lackeys of Muhammad V have not, and with every passing day it becomes more clear that if we were to invade, the illegitimate kingdom of Morocco would collapse in a matter of days. While this could draw the ire of the Germans, it would finally end the Rifian insurgency and restore some of the pride Spain has had such shortage of in the past since 1898."

Hardly anyone saw these ruffians attempting to move to parliamentary politics, but Albinana has announced his bid to run in the upcoming elections on a platform of bringing back a sense of pride to Spain and putting to sword those who would slander the great nation. Focusing mainly on rural farmers and Catholic workers, PNE seeks to offer an alternative to the radical anti-democratic monarchists of Renovacion Espanola and the more moderate king’s favourites in Accion Popular. Few in Spain expect PNE to be able to moderate its course, and even fewer expect them to win in the elections, but the political landscape of Spain has certainly shifted into an interesting direction."

When we acquired this small colonial holding from the Portuguese in 1778 as part of the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, many expected Spain to expand further inland, using the small outpost as a launching platform into the heart of the Dark Continent. Yet the long distance to mainland Spain, rough conditions at the area, low number of settlers and the preference of Maghreb as the better colonial holding led to the neglect of Equatorial Guinea and through this, wider Spanish colonies in central Africa. However, some still dreamed of a true Spanish colony in Gabon and Cameroon, though the last of these hopes were shattered when the colonial colossus of Mittelafrika was formed.

But as America spirals into chaos and destroys itself, Cuba is once more adrift, left barely over the water after American capital and industry packs its bags and heads back to the maelstrom that is the American civil war. These news have taken the intellectual and militarist circles of Madrid by storm, and a wave of imperialist fury has caused Spaniards to appeal to the crown and current government to cross the Atlantic Ocean and strike Havana, reclaiming the jewel of the Caribbean and restoring the pride lost to the barbarous Yankees. However, the long distance to the island and the long period of independence of Cuba has enjoyed have caused this imperialist movement to garner its fair share of critics, calling the colonialist dreamers naive and chauvinistic predators.

However, with Spain’s loyal sons triumphant over the Syndicalist vandals and terrorists, we can set to work on reclaiming France’s lost colonies in Africa and Asia.

Plans such as these are likely results of highly delusional minds, but as the sense of imperial grandeur begins to seep back into the minds of Spaniards, other, less diabolical, ideas have been put forward. One of these imperialist plans is the reclamation of Spanish Netherlands, an area that has not been a part of our empire since the Wars of Spanish Succession. Originally acquired by the Spanish Habsburgs after the split in the main Habsburg family in the mid 1550s, the provinces managed to slip away from Spanish grasp due to domestic weakness and exploitative neighboring powers. Many pacifist leaders, such as Julian Besteiro of PSOE and Angel Pestana of Partido Sindicalista have denounced any such ideas, but the more hawkish members of the Spanish parliament, especially among Accion Popular, Partido Nacionalista Espanola and Partido Radical have supported these ideas. While Netherlands itself is a price all of its own, situated right between the great powers of Europe and boasting a strong navy, its colonial possessions in Asia and the Americas are an even more lucrative price. Still, this venture could easily be considered ridiculous by the international audience, given that Spanish rule was highly contested by the Dutch during our almost two hundred year-long rule.

One of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, reborn as a ad hoc solution to the problem of Italian socialists gaining power. While Ferdinando III, the new king, only reluctantly accepted the position as a temporary solution, in these last two decades, circumstances have led to the kingdom becoming a mainstay of the peninsula. The instability of Spain prevented us from offering more than moral support and officer advisors, but now that Spain is finally relatively stable, we could offer more.

While we may have our differences and grievances based on historical realities, as the memories of Spanish colonization fade among our South and Central American descendants, Spain is inching closer into the cultural sphere of these nations.\n\n The ease of communication brought about by the shared values and language has made Spanish companies easier clients than those of our German and Anglo rivals, and even in the deeply depressed state that the world has sunk into, many Spanish companies make profit selling products to our former colonies and vice versa. As such, movements promoting further unity between the world’s various Hispanic peoples have gained traction. Here is Spain, prominent Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal has suggested creating a brotherly union with our former colonies, focusing on mutual cooperation and prosperity over Spanish domination of them. These ideas are not without their supporters in the New World either, as famous writers such as Uruguayan poet Juana de Ibarbourou and Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fernández have promoted Hispanism as an alternative to the United States promotion of Yankee-dominated Pan-Americanism.

sprd.1114.d:0 "As we now lord over the French lands, claiming them as our own as is only just and true, the matter of Belgium has been raised to the king’s attention. As Spain and France are now united under one banner, Belgium and to some extent, Netherlands have been noted as possible future conquests. Belgium, while a nation of many different language groups, has a very large French-speaking population, which has led many to argue that it should be part of France altogether, as it should have always been simply a state of France from the beginning. Similarly, many Spaniards have echoed these sentiments, claiming that Spain holds a claim on the territory given our domination of Netherlands, and through them, Belgium, earlier in our history. While these claims are far weaker than those of our French compatriots, the irredentist sentiment has found a lot of support among our more right-wing elements of government and political parties. Organizations like Renovacion Espanola or Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica have called us to launch an immediate invasion, and whatever elements of Action Francaise, that have joined our regime that is, have generally supported this attack. However, there are others who view it as pushing the new union too far, as a war right as we are integrating the former Communard lands could give enough support for the splinter remnants of the Communards to revolt and cause significant issues."
sprd.1114.a:0 "Belgium was once ours, and it shall be again!"
sprd.1114.b:0 "Yes, let us refrain from an invasion right now!"

sprd.1143.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants to join the Donau-Adriabund"
sprd.1143.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has announced recently that it wishes to join the Donau-Adriabund. How shall we respond?"
sprd.1143.a:0 "Absolutely, they are welcome."
sprd.1143.b:0 "It's not a good idea."

sprd.1150.d:0 "With the world engulfed in war, we have chosen to not join the various alliances of the world. However, this does not mean that we cannot get involved, in fact, just like during the first Weltkrieg, we should choose to support a side in the conflict through preferential trade. Obviously supporting the Internationale is out of the question, but we could trade with their enemies, either Germany’s gigantic yet highly unstable faction, Reichspakt, or Canada’s weak but highly revanchist faction, the Entente. Traditionally, Spain has had good trade relations with both, but we cannot supply both sides with meaningful material for war as their logistical needs are highly different. As such, which side will we support through preferential trade deals?"
sprd.1150.a:0 "Support the righteous cause of the British exiles."
sprd.1150.b:0 "Not aligning with the German hegemon would be ridiculous."

sprd.1151.t:0 "Italian Christians Reach Out to Us"
sprd.1151.d:0 "As DLE has begun to drift more towards Christian democracy, and has integrated many of Spain’s smaller Christian movements into it, it was only inevitable that as we integrated Italy into our empire, these movements would mingle with the long and proud tradition of political Catholicism that the Apennines peninsula possesses. Curiously enough, we have been approached by the Partito Popolare Italiano in hopes of uniting our two parties, as they view our movement more worthy of their support than the somewhat radical Accion Popular. Their ideology, Popularism, is a mixture of Catholic values and Christian democrat idealism, but refined to the point where they seek to create a society of harmonious communities, where differences in cultures between groups would not be a source of friction but of strength. Popularism is notably less focused on the individual than our movement generally is, but we could utilize their connections with the Italian rural folk to forge a new pact between the Christians of our two territories."
sprd.1151.a:0 "Collaborate them but retain different party structures."
sprd.1151.b:0 "Let us merge our parties and adopt this Popularist thoughtform."

sprd.1153.t:0 "Allies in Italy"
sprd.1153.d:0 "After the territory of Two Sicilies was added to our realm, Bourbon rule over Italy was once again solidified properly. Interestingly enough, while the administration of his new state was being organized, many Spaniards from the ruling party PNE came across their Italian monarchist counterparts, and as part of this cultural and ideological exchange, PNE members were introduced to the concept of Neobourbonismo. While generally a rather Sicilian thing, its main tenet is utmost loyalty to the House of Bourbon and general hardliner monarchism, something which PNE has come to be known for quite well during its brief period as rulers of Spain. While this ideology is still in its infancy, many within PNE have called for us to adopt parts of it in order to better hone our own base of monarchism, and partially also to integrate the Italian monarchists into our rank easier."
sprd.1153.a:0 "No, we must uphold party integrity."
sprd.1153.b:0 "Let us adopt this veneration of the Bourbon monarchy."

sprd.1154.t:0 "Gaullism"
sprd.1154.d:0 "As Spain has come to own the territories of the former French exiles, many within Accion Popular have approached this with great jubilation of finally achieving Spain’s Africanist vision. However, curiously, as our officers have been mingling with those Nationalist French generals who weren’t too bitter about their loss to not reply to them, they came across general Charles de Gaulle, a well-known French general and a close ally of Marshall Petain. Despite his grievances against our government, he shared many of his military views with our soldiers as many of our generals had fought alongside de Gaulle in the Rif War. Eventually talks turned to politics, and the French general shared that he considered the actions of the Accion Popular government in Spain to be quite inspirational to him in some measure. \n\nMany generals, also members of Accion Popular, wanted to know why this was, and de Gaulle shared his idea of a true French state, one built upon centralization of power, strong personality cult, limited welfare statism and some degree of democracy. As the talks between Accion Popular-aligned generals and de Gaulle continued long into the night, the next day these ideas of de Gaulle were brought to the attention of some Accion Popular politicians who had been in Algiers, creating a new colonial administration. As de Gaulle’s tenets spread among the party elites, some suggested that the party leader, “el Jefe” Gil-Robles, should adopt this ‘Gaullism’ as Accion Popular’s new way of thinking. Some find this absolutely preposterous, given how the ideology has never been put into action, but others see it as a rejuvenating force in a party that has for so long been seen as a stagnating one."
sprd.1154.a:0 "Absolutely not, frogs cannot govern."
sprd.1154.b:0 "Might be worth a shot."

sprd.1155.t:0 "Italian Republican Ideals"
sprd.1155.d:0 "Upon the conquest of Italy, Izquierda Espanola found many former Italian republicans who approved many of our values, and this shared vision has brought the two peoples closer together. This has, obviously, also reached the Spanish academia, who have intermingled with their Italian counterparts, and as many of Izquierda Espanola’s members are educated members of various schools and universities, it was inevitable that the Italians would influence our politicians. By far the strongest influence has been that of Gaetano Salvemini, whose ideology is remarkably close to that of Manuel Azana, promoting strong, anti-clerical republicanism as a means to curtail the radicalism of left and right-wing extremists while still enacting very radical reforms that would transform Italian society to be more equal, free and fair, without the need for tyranny or ignorance. Many have seen this similarity of ideology as worthy of integrating Salvemini’s much smaller party, Partido Democratico del Lavoro, into Izquierda Espanola, but this would obviously mean adopting some of their ideological leanings as well."
sprd.1155.a:0 "Invite them into the Popular Front but remain separate."
sprd.1155.b:0 "Let us adopt Salvemini’s ideals."

sprd.1160.t:0 "Selling Rio de Oro?"
sprd.1160.d:0 "As Spain has begun to take back its rightful territory in the world, it would have been too good to be true if there had been no hitch-ups or issues. One of the simplest is the lack of funds, as colonial ventures are notoriously expensive. Now, we could of course just raise taxes or simply stop expanding, but given the recent uptick in nationalist fervour, this would likely be quite unpopular, and while the colonies are expected to be profitable, these profits will take a while to start mounting up, just as they did with our colony of Rif after we captured said territory and got its iron mines up and running. But while Rif is quite profitable thanks to its iron ore, its counterpart on the other side of Morocco proper, Rio de Oro, has not been nearly as great of a venture. In fact, back in 1898, right after our humiliating defeat at the hands of the Yanks, the crown attempted to sell it Austria, but this was blocked by the other part of Austria-Hungary’s dual monarchy, the Hungarians. Now, however, reports have come in that Austrians would be willing to renegotiate this deal, and in exchange for a foothold in Africa, they would offer us funds to fuel our colonial ventures. While this would mean giving away yet another of our few colonies, it would be given to an ally of ours and quite frankly, the territory of Rio de Oro is not that important to the Spaniards. As such, the king has approved the Austrian request, but the government must approve it as well."
sprd.1160.a:0 "Sell the land, it’s of no use to us anyway."
sprd.1160.b:0 "No, we almost lost Rif, we can’t lose more."


sprd.1169.t:0 "Black Monday is finally over!"
sprd.1169.d:0 "After so many economic hardships, the political strife that almost brought an end to our nation and the international repercussions of our issues, we have finally bested the monster of Black Monday and the terrible recession it brought in its wake. Much must still be done for Spain to return to prosperity and greatness once more, but even now, people rise their faces from the dirt and look up to the sky, feeling hope for the first time in ages. The economy will improve, and we will bring Spain to its rightful place in the sun!"
sprd.1169.a:0 "Viva España!"

sprd.1001.t:0 "Experimental Technologies from Our Latin Brothers"
sprd.1001.d:0 "Seeking to put their recent technological breakthroughs to the test, Spanish aeronautical engineers working off American designs came together to create new military hardware to be tested on the frontlines here at the fringes of the Latin world. The centerpiece invention of these new shipments is the Ciera C5. These ‘hoverflies’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters or advanced autogyros by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these helicopters have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers while also being adept at recon and supply. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Spanish sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of our alliance."
sprd.1001.a:0 "We will ensure these are put to good use."
