### New Catalan Events ###

CAT.20.t:0 "The [GetYear] Catalan Elections"
CAT.20.d:0 "For the first time in history, free Catalan Republic stands alone, liberated from Castilian scum by the sacrifices of its noble people. But as the new state consolidates itself on the Mediterranean coast, the citizens of free Catalonia had pressured interim president Lluis Companys to hold elections so that the Catalan people can begin building our democracy, and eventually with no further attacks from Spain coming, Companys agreed. The elections are bound to be heavily contested, as seven parties have campaigned heavily for the people’s mandate.\n\nRepresenting the provisional government’s main party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya is a social democratic party with great political capital in Catalonia through the influence of its leader, Lluis Companys, though many consider him too sympathetic to the syndicalists. Promoting a more moderate centre-left ideology, Acció Catalana Republicana, led by Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, seeks to create a progressive, liberal republic in Catalonia. A former member of ACR, Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, has announced that his party, Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, will also be running in the elections, on a similar platform to ACR but with a very noticeable Christian democrat stint, mixing Catholic values with compatible liberal ideas.\n\nOn the right-side of the Catalan democratic parties stand three notably different parties, with the conservative and markedly more pro-Spanish Liga Catalana, the monarcho-socialist Partido Socialista Monárquico running as the black horse candidate and the big-tent nationalist party of Daniel Cardona i Civit, Nosoltros Sols, known for their famous assanssination attempt against Alfonso XIII. Liga Regionalista has managed to claw back from irrelevancy thanks to their newfound support among the Spaniards of Catalonia, while the previously unknown party PSM has found supporters among derelict Carlists, Alfonsists and unionists of the new country. The radical nationalist rhetoric of Nosoltros Sols meanwhile has captured the hearts and minds of many young Catalans, and may just buy them the victory. However, as the polling stations close, the winner becomes clear, and it is.."

CAT.21.t:0 "The Catalonian Socialist Elections"
CAT.21.d:0 "As the red and black flags flutter over the roofs of Catalonia, the new socialist order has slowly solidified its position among the populace of the young nation. Many feared that the Partit Català Proletari would not give in to the demands of its temporary allies, and that they would form a vanguard party similar to the original Bolsheviks of Russia. These fears, to the surprise and relief of many within Catalonia, have turned out to be false. Jaume Compte i Canelles, leader of PCP, has announced an election to be held between the members of the socialist alliance, with the recipient of the most votes becoming the young nation’s new helmsman for the span of four years.\n\n The PCP runs on a platform of nationalist Marxism, seeking to implement centralist, highly radical reforms that would seek the emergence of planned economy nation-wide, led from the top of the party leadership downwards to the grassroots worker’s movements. PCP is also the most Catalanist of the parties and puts its fiery nationalist rhetoric first to appeal to the many nationalists of Catalonia who would otherwise steer clear of socialist parties. The combat squads of CNT-FAI remnants, Nosotros, led by the venerable Catalan anarchist Juan Garcia i Oliver, were first to announce their participation, seeking to create a federal anarcho-syndicalist territory within Catalonia, one ruled by action, violence against the forces of counter-revolution and fervent reorganization of the territory towards communal aims and ownership.\n\n Unió Socialista de Catalunya, the local broad coalition of communists, socialists and non-anarchist syndicalists, have also stated that they will run in the elections. Their party platform is in many ways similar to PCP, but their leader, Joan Comorera i Soler, is especially focused on the issues of security and stability of the socialist state, claiming that his main goals are combating the chaos and lawlessness brought upon Catalonia after the revolution. Finally, the remaining survivors of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, rallying under the beaten and battered Lluis Companys i Jover, have declared to run on a platform of moderate syndicalization of Catalonia, seeking to enshrine a similar degree of red democracy in the young state as the French have managed to achieve in their commune. They are likely to gain many votes from the surviving republicans from more liberal parties, as well as the support of agrarian vineyard workers and other peasants thanks to their somewhat rural-minded outlook."

CAT.22.t:0 "The Post-Coup Elections"
CAT.22.d:0 "As stability returns to Catalonia, the second Catalan democratic elections are held far earlier than was initially planned. Compared to the first elections, far fewer parties are also taking part in the elections, as after general Batet defeated JEREC and consolidated his rule, he made sure to purge the republican administration from various ideological firebrands and agitators, leaving only trusted moderates as possible electable parties. Batet himself has decided to join the nascent nationalist party, Partit Nacionalista Català, which up until recently had maintained connections to Estat Catala and Nosaltres Sols radicals, but found itself bereft of support after their disbandment. The party is now mostly made up of right-wing nationalists and military officers.\n\n Both Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and Acció Catalana Republicana have undergone swift changes as well, as after the death of Lluis Companys, Josep Tarradellas took over the party leadership and guided it towards a more left-wing nationalist direction. While still heavily involved in labour affairs, Tarradellas is known for his conciliatory stance with Spaniards, and has advocated for wider, more inclusive nationalism, renaming the party to Partit Nacionalista Republicà d'Esquerra.\n\n Acció Catalana Republicana has also underwent changes after its leader, Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, died by the hands of the Escamots, and its new leader, Joaquim de Camps i Arboix, has renamed the party to simply Acció Catalana, given its shift away from republican radicalism of Nicolau d’Olwer. Finally, the only party to remain largely unchanged is the Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, still governed by Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, and the party continues to follow Christian democratic principles. Few expect the other parties to win, however, as Batet’s success in governing Catalonia is bound to give his new party an immense boost in the elections, but as always, the results are not rock solid. Thus, the new governing party of Catalonia is.."

CAT.109.t:0 "Catalonia Invites Us to the League of Oppressed States"
CAT.109.d:0 "As the streets of Barcelona echoed with occasional rifle shots and sporadic fires still roared along the path of destruction left behind by the Escamot militias, the future of Catalonia seemed to have been decided. At the seat of Catalonia’s power, Palau del Parlament de Catalunya, the masses of the Escamots had formed a sea of olive green shirts and black berets as the paramilitaries assembled before their leader, Josep Dencàs, observing his supporters from the balcony of the parliament building, the members of parliament watching outside fearfully from the windows behind Dencàs. As the final formations reached their positions, the Catalan nationalist leader began his speech addressing the men of JEREC below him.\n\n He spoke at length of the horrors of the Spanish rule, the shackling of Catalonia to a dying empire, and how the sycophants of Lluis Companys and Francesc Cambo had sold the region to Spain in exchange for crumbs, only attempting to escape the clutches of Castile after the inevitable betrayal by the Bourbons. According to Dencàs, such weak-minded rule would no longer be tolerated, as the new Catalan state would emulate the successes of their Charterist brothers and form a truly nationalist and syndicalist republic, capable of withstanding the tribulations that the future would bring. However, before Dencàs was able to finish, the edge of the parliament’s yard filled with commotion, as at least a dozen tiznaos marked with the symbols of Exercit Popular broke through the fences and barricades. Rolling to a halt, the vehicles leveled their guns at the Escamot militias, completely unprepared for such a fierce invasion.\n\n The military, having dispatched the Escamot rearguards in a swift fashion, now stormed into the yard, hundreds of men armed with the best weapons Catalonia’s factories could offer. General Domènec Batet i Mestres, the senior officer in charge of Catalan army, arrived to the scene on horseback, and seeing the overwhelming advantage of his troops, offered Dencàs his last chance to surrender, imploring him to think of the humanitarian losses a clash of this scale would cause. Dencàs, appearing defiant, started to call upon his militia supporters to strike the army down in a last stand, but he was interrupted once more as Batet ordered one of the tiznaos to fire at the balcony.\n\n The leader of JEREC was engulfed in the explosion, and the Escamot unity faltered, some seeking to avenge their leader before being cut down, while the majority of the others fled from the scene in a panicked rout. As the guns grew silent and the military focused on the chase at hand, Batet, still on horseback, proclaimed to the members of parliament that the Exercit Popular would restore order in Barcelona and beyond, and after that, the democratic regime could slowly be restored. The future seemed hazy for the young republic, but at least the threat of the Charterists had been averted, and for many, that was a victory enough."

CAT.200.t:0 "The End of Catalan Republic"
CAT.200.d:0 "The few remaining Mossos troops still left alive dropped their weapons, and with a resounding clang, the resistance of Catalan government came to an end. Couple cars full of the most important government politicians had attempted to break through the encirclement, only to be riddled with bullets. Lluis Companys and Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, were among the fallen, but for the most part, the parliament building had been captured with only a few escapees. With heavily-armed Escamot guards flanking him, and the vigilant eyes of Miquel Badia’s stormtrooper squads watching the crowd, Josep Dencas climbed to the podium of the Catalan parliament. The politicians before him watched the man with a mixture of fear, hatred, and some, with opportunism. Dencas began his speech by denouncing the former government, calling its attempt to arrest JEREC leadership a clear sign that they had no interest in the actual lives of Catalans, and simply wanted to grab as much power as possible.\n\n He railed against Companys, calling him a weak-minded fool for collaborating with the Spaniards and anarchists, and claimed that now that the president was gone, Catalonia could finally be transformed into a state that was both nationalist, and syndicalist, not the aimless ultranationalism of Nosaltres Sols nor the anarchist-compromised syndicalism of CNT, but a truly efficient hybrid that would propel Catalonia into a proper nationhood.  Dencàs claimed that following the victory of JEREC, the Catalan parliament would be dissolved, to safeguard the state from such opportunists as Companys, and that under JEREC, the state would oversee the removal of Spanish influences from the society once and for all.\n\n According to Dencàs, the lingering Spanish influence would forever taint the Catalan purity, both spiritually and physically, and thus it would have to be exorcized from the new nation. Ending his speech by shouting ‘Visca Catalunya’, his only choir were the gathered Escamot troops, with the rest of the chamber remaining silent in utter disbelief at the turn of events. As Badia began to round up the politicians, who would be imprisoned until those useful enough for the regime could be separated from the dissidents, Dencàs turned towards the Palau’s front, aiming to climb onto the balcony to address his men, the Escamot legions gathered in front of the parliament building. A new order had dawned upon Catalonia, and yet another nation of the world had seen the new ideas of Charter Totalism in action.."

CAT.205.t:0 "The Midnight Raid"
CAT.205.d:0 "The night hang over Catalonia like a veil woven of black satin, and the lights of Barcelona managed to block out the shine of stars. The city streets, so noisy during the day as workmen and soldiers toiled to remove the rubble and debris from the streets caused by the JEREC coup attempt, were now almost dead silent. The regime of Exercit Popular, under the stewardship of General Domenec Batet, had enforced a strict martial law over Catalonia, though Barcelona remained the only part where it was truly effective. Yet as the military rule solidified, the number of night-time patrols were cut in half and even then, were mostly manned by conscripts instead of the earlier elite squads of the army. Yet the threat of an insurgency had slowly grown under the seemingly tranquill streets of Barcelona, and now, Miquel Badia, or Capità Collons as he had become known as, sought revenge for the fall of JEREC. The remaining Escamots, not particularly strong in numbers, had coalesced under the rule of Badia after he managed to evade Batet’s grasp, and the recent removal of Batet had proven an excellent opportunity for the nationalist leader to strike once more.\n\n The army, still quite inexperienced and not particularly motivated, had become even less so after their hero Batet was removed and replaced with an uncharismatic man of Spanish birth. As the moon rose over Catalan sky, Badia’s small force slipped into the sewers, traveling long hours amid the darkness as they made their way towards the military headquarters. The barracks of the IV Organic brigade, where Batet had made his final decision to join the Catalan revolt, were now the very head of Catalan state, where the new clique of officers prepared to consolidate their rule over the young nation.\n\n Yet as the guards of the complex prepared for a watch shift, they were overwhelmed in mere seconds by Escamot commandoes, slipping the watchmen’s throats before any alarm could be rang. Rest of their force rose from the sewer pipes and quickly prepared their gear, consisting of multiple machine pistols, carbines and grenades. The force split into multiple squads, which all attacked different sections of the military complex. During the next half an hour, machine gun fire and explosions rang all around the different buildings of the headquarters, army guards being slain in their beds from automatic fire or blown to pieces by grenades. Those few that managed to resist, were cut down mercilessly by the invaders, though not before taking a few Escamots with them. Badia himself led a squad into the very heart of the complex, his group storming the officers’ room and decapitating the leadership of Exercit Popular in one fell swoop. Utilizing the radio transmitters of the base, Badia sent his ultimatum to rest of Catalonia, denouncing the leadership of Exercit Popular as Spanish-backed autocrats, and declaring the rule of his militant group, the Holy Brotherhood of the Black Banner over Catalonia."

CAT.206.t:0 "Choosing the Right Head to Wear the Catalan Crown"
CAT.206.d:0 "Now that the Monarcho-Socialists have truly consolidated power, and Catalonia is secured under the legitimate rulers once more, the party leadership has began to consider sending an invitation to the future king of Catalonia. This is obviously very precarious matter, as the monarch options are Spanish, and thus prone to prompt a very strong response from the Catalan population. However, the military is on our side, and the populist strategies utilized by the monarcho-socialists have made the government very popular among the workers. It is also noteworthy that the Catalan nationalist infighting seems to have made their resolve far weaker than before, so perhaps the time has come to reunite Catalonia with the crown.\n\n But the question of a monarch is far from easy, as the Spanish crown’s honour was stained after the legitimate king was pushed into exile. Inviting him back would be a sure-fire way to make the Catalans revolt, but there are others who could fill his role. The most likely option is the first heir of Alfonso XIII, the younger Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, who was removed from the succession after his marriage to a Cuban commoner. This could make him more appealing to the people as well, showing that he is a man of the people first and a monarch second. However, his relation to the Spanish royals, even as an outcast, could be a problem.\n\n Other options are available, however, as we could instead invite Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Falcó to the throne. He is also connected to the Spanish royals, but nonetheless, he is notable for being the a far descendant of Martin I of Aragon, who ruled Catalonia and Aragon in the Middle Ages. While outlandish, it would be a more local choice, and the restoration of the House of Barcelona could appeal more to our subjects than the restoration of a Bourbon to the throne. Jacobo is also a distinguished diplomat and politician, and while he may have his reservations of helping a new Catalan state, it might appeal to him given the chaos in mainland Spain now. Alternatively, if Jacobo himself does not want to become the king, we could offer the crown to his daughter and only child, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart. While quite young, he could prove to be a good monarch for our purposes given that she does not come with the burden of connections with the Spanish monarchy, at least not to the degree of the other candidates.

CAT.207.t:0 "The Future Course of Partido Socialista Monárquico"
CAT.207.d:0 "The monarcho-socialists of Catalonia have thus far leaned more into their monarchist roots, aligning more with the various nobles and traditionalists left in Catalonia to ensure that the movement doesn’t crumble at the face of its rather gigantic task of governing the Catalans. However, while monarchists to the death, the old members of the party have always also had a strong love for the people, and sought to merge the love for the working class of non-Marxist socialism with the loyalty to the true leader of the nation, the monarch. As such, the party leadership, especially the more left-leaning members like Elías Miró Solé and Francisco Martínez, have sought to limit the influence of the more traditionalist clique of the Partido Socialista Monárquico. This struggle has largely remained in the sidelines, with more important problems taking the spotlight of the party’s efforts, but now that things have stabilized, the party must finally choose its actual policies. The socialist-aligned members have been bolstered by a few moderate socialists of ERC and USC, as well as previously apolitical workers, and these men now call for the movement to truly go socialist in nature, though still highly moderate and loyal to the crown. Others, more moderate members such as José Ferrando Albors, have instead lobbied for the adoption of a social democratic model, not fully leaning to socialism but still leaving the more traditionalist mindsets of old behind. Still, the strength of the traditionalists, backed by some military officers, is not to be taken lightly, and they could be difficult to dislodge from their place of power."

The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."
