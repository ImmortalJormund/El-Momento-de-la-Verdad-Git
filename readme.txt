Hello there cool dudes and cold-blooded comrades

Here's a few tips on how to install mod. First, go to Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod and paste the mod there.
 Then change the mod descriptor file to match the path of your PC.
 That should do it. If it doesn't, join the KX Discord and come call me an useless cunt in the kx-submods-chat.
 
 Secondly, once the mod works, you may want to know that this is an alpha or beta build depending on how much leeway you'll give me. Much of the mod is very WIP, and thus I'd recommend sticking to Spain for the time being.
 Paths are relatively easy to get. As Spain, avoid the civil war by not banning CNT-FAI and Carlists and by focusing on diplomacy, then restore monarchy, restore elections and elect the party you want.
 For democratic Syndicalists and Radical Socialists, do not ban them. For democratic Paternal Autocrats, ban socialists.
 
 That's about it. For the separatist revolt, do as before but go absolutist by not restoring elections and do the first focus for the event "King's Speech". Separatist revolt happens like a month later and you can swap to Basques, Catalans, Galicians or Rif.
 Basques have content but it's very WIP. You can get dem paths by completing the initial tree and doing the election focus. For syndies, go SocCon or AuthDem and crack down on Syndies in the "Comrades of the Coast" event, and they will coup. 
 For Carlist Basques, crack down on them if you're SocDem or RadSoc, and they will coup. For Jacobins, go Syndicalist and an event should fire that allows you to swap to Jacobin in a coup.
